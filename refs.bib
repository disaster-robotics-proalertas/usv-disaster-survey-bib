The key objectives of the project are to develop, implement, and demonstrate in the course of missions at sea the efficacy of a number of innovative systems to assist human divers during the execution of demanding scientific and commercial activities in hazardous underwater environments. At the core of CADDY is the development of an underwater robot that plays the role of a buddy diver and a surface robot to improve guidance, monitoring, assistance, and safety of the diver's mission. The present paper gives a brief summary of the work done during the first year of the project towards the development and testing of the systems required for coordinated surface / underwater vehicle operations. We consider the cases where the leader is either the surface or the underwater vehicle. The architecture adopted for multiple vehicle coordination is described. Results of tests with the MEDUSA class of autonomous marine vehicles show the efficacy of the systems developed for navigation and coordinated motion control.},

abstract={This paper describes a new class of autonomous marine vehicles named Medusa and highlights their role in a number of EU projects addressing multiple vehicle scenarios. The MEDUSA vehicles, with surface and diving versions, were designed and built at the Institute for Systems and Robotics, IST, Univ. de Lisboa, Portugal as a result of an effort aimed at affording researchers and practitioners of marine robotics tools to: i) assess the efficacy of cooperative motion control and navigation algorithms and ii) seamlessly execute scientific and commercial missions with multiple robots at sea. We first define the problem of designing the MEDUSA-class of vehicles by describing the desired functional requirements that motivated their development and then present our solution. Mechanical and electrical design considerations that relate to the requirements are explained, and the software architecture is described. This includes a brief overview of the navigation system, the main lower-level control loops which other features can build upon, and some of the higher-level algorithms for multiple-vehicle cooperative missions. We also illustrate the functionality of the mission control system, a dedicated software suite that allows operators to seamlessly program and follow the state of execution of cooperative missions involving multiple vehicles, possibly running different operations or missions in parallel. Finally, we summarize the participation of IST and the MEDUSA vehicles in a number of representative EC-funded Marine Robotics-related projects.},

abstract={This paper presents the autonomous tracking and following of a marine vessel by an Unmanned Surface Vehicle in the presence of dynamic obstacles while following the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS) rules. The motion prediction for the target vessel is based on Monte-Carlo sampling of dynamically feasible and collision-free paths with fuzzy weights, leading to a predicted path resembling anthropomorphic driving behavior. This prediction is continuously optimized for a particular target by learning the necessary parameters for a 3-degree-of-freedom model of the vessel and its maneuvering behavior from its path history without any prior knowledge. The path planning for the USV with COLREGS is achieved on a grid-based map in a single stage by incorporating A* path planning with Artificial Terrain Costs for dynamically changing obstacles. Various scenarios for interaction, including multiple civilian and adversarial vessels, are handled by the planner with ease. The effectiveness of the algorithms has been demonstrated both in representative simulations and on-water experiments.},

abstract="The maritime environmental disasters are generally caused by collision, grounding, stranding heavy weather, explosion or fire. These disasters can cause spillage of oil, bunker, dirty water or chemical harmful substances. It is well known that the most known environmental disaster in maritime having serious impacts on marine life is oil spill. Although several intelligence techniques like heuristic search algorithms, machine learning, and fuzzy approach have been employed in maritime sector with various purposes, in the literature, applications of intelligent techniques for the solution of the maritime environmental disaster problems are quite limited. In this study, an intelligent system which consists of model-base, database, environmental disaster management actions, ship operation management actions, user interface, environmental disaster modelling, and decision support unit has been proposed. The proposed system, called as Maritime Intelligent Environmental Disaster Management (MIEDM), is aimed at strengthening operating mechanism along with the mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery phases to eliminate the potential impacts of maritime environmental disasters.",

abstract={ Remotely operated underwater vehicles are mobile robots increasingly used in underwater applications; these devices are widely used and suitable for different scenarios, for example, for patrolling and monitoring and also for underwater interventions. In the last 30 years, the remotely operated underwater vehicles have become more and more advanced; at the same rate with the progressive technological development of these vehicles, the market of the specialized component industry is fast-increasing. Generally speaking, a remotely operated underwater vehicle allows to investigate areas inaccessible or too dangerous for human beings. The use of remotely operated underwater vehicles during a mission, with the related implication of support ships and specialized pilots, or the involvement of professional divers, is usually associated with high costs. The reduction of these costs is an important topic in the underwater robotic field and the easy piloting of these mobile robots is a crucial aspect in their development. This article describes Nemo remotely operated underwater vehicle, a remotely operated underwater vehicle prototype specifically designed for the exploration of the Costa Concordia wreck, Isola del Giglio, Italy. Nemo remotely operated underwater vehicle can be considered a mini-remotely operated underwater vehicle, that is, a remotely operated underwater vehicle with weight less than 25 kg and easily deployable from a small boat. This article describes the main characteristics of the vehicle: the onboard control logic and on the development of a user-friendly graphical user interface for underwater navigation able to take advantage of its high maneuverability. It is worth to note that the developed graphical user interface enables to operate the vehicle even to inexperienced pilots. Preliminary experimental data collected during navigation are provided. }

It is a common belief that experimentation in mobile robotics has not yet reached a level of maturity comparable with that reached in science, for example in physics, considered as the paradigm of a mature, stable, and well-founded scientific discipline. In this paper, starting from a representative sample of the current state of the art, we identify some basic issues of experiments in mobile robot localization and mapping. These issues, when viewed in the context of some general principles about experiments in science and engineering, lead us to derive some insightful considerations on the role of experiments in mobile robotics.

abstract={Clean water is a natural resource that is crucial for life but has very little protection. This was exemplified by the Gold King Mine spill on August 7, 2015, in which three million gallons of acidic mine drainage was released into the head waters of the Animas River. The Animas River is the source for five water supply systems, providing drinking water for tens of thousands of people and irrigation water for a myriad of agricultural operations. Incidents such as this happen regularly and create the need for persistent monitoring of the water in rivers, lakes and reservoirs world wide. To this end, this paper presents the development of a network of three autonomous surface vehicles equipped with water monitoring sensors for water quality monitoring and an algorithm validation testbed. These vehicles are sustained by solar power and equipped with 3G wireless communication for real-time data transmission. Here, we detail the vehicles and the networked system, and provide results from field deployments. An additional outcome of this project is the engagement and collaboration with the local community and the robotic community at large. By making the database view-able to the public the local community can be involved in evaluating the quality of their water. By allowing the public to plan paths for the vehicles, multi-robot sampling algorithms and crowd-sourced control techniques can be methodically developed and systematically analyzed.},

For achieving a complete representation of the lake, the distance travelled should be maximized instead of minimized as in the classic Travelling Salesman Problem. The evolutionary technique known as Genetic Algorithm is applied for finding the optimal solution. The simulations show promising results even in the case that some constrains are included in the problem.},

Initially, we will study the behaviour of jellyfish and their impact and interaction with industry. Motivated by the need to improve current detection systems, we will propose a swarm behaviour that will be formalized with a microscopic model. We will discuss both the convergence and the scalability of the model. Finally, a macroscopic model will be provided to predict the probability that an individual is placed in a position at a given moment. "

abstract={This paper presents a review of research work done on various aspects of control system approaches of unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in order to improve the course keeping performance. Various methods have been used to produce a course keeping control system for manoeuvring system of USV. However, the review reveals that the adaptive backstepping control system is a powerful tool for the design of controllers for nonlinear systems or transformable to form a tight feedback parameter. It is very suitable for the automated control system of USV in relative motion that involves the disturbances from waves and wind. Fuzzy logic control also had been suggested as an alternative approach for complex systems with uncertain dynamics and those with nonlinearities. This method does not rely on the mathematical models, but the heuristic approach. Further studies may be conducted to combine the control method approach mentioned above to develop a real time system with robust control laws to the motions of a USV in waves, usually at a specific speed, including station keeping or heading in sinusoidal and irregular waves}

Among others, representative examples in this way are the missions under the name Challenger One, Volcano and SB02 through surface and underwater gliding vehicles, performed mostly in the surrounding subtropical waters of the ESTOC ocean observatory in the Canary Islands archipelago.

abstract="Abstract The evaluation of emergency, disaster and crisis management exercises supports both individual and organizational learning, facilitates the development of response capabilities, and helps to determine whether the current level of preparedness is good enough. Nevertheless, despite its importance in the field of disaster risk management, there is a lack of a comprehensive overview of research in the area. The aim of the paper is to provide such an overview. A scoping study identified the key contributions on the topic of disaster exercise evaluation, provides an overview of research in the area, and analyses opportunities for future work. The purpose, function and form of the evaluation provided the framework for the analysis, which was applied to the scoping study results. The results indicate a lack of academic interest. Although exercises take place on a regular basis and are often used for research purposes, their evaluations are seldom the focus of attention per se. Moreover, contributions that do focus on evaluations are spread over several disciplines. Nevertheless, the results indicate that recent contributions are becoming more coherent as they build on each other (or at least refer to each other), even if they are produced within different disciplines. Despite encouraging signs of a more cohesive scientific corpus on the evaluation of disaster exercises, there is still room for improvement. The scientific discourse would benefit from greater clarity regarding: (1) the purpose and context in which a specific evaluation method is designed to be used; (2) what the method needs to do (or produce) in order for it to fulfill the purpose; and (3) how the method achieves its goal and thereby fulfills its purpose. Moreover, in order to help researchers to build on each other's work and suggest improvements to evaluation methods, it is urgent that the supporting evidence (for example, empirical data or logical reasoning) for claims regarding the usefulness of a specific method is clearly presented. This is likely to lead to a more vigorous scientific discourse, which will result in increasingly relevant and robust arguments related to how to approach the problem of evaluating disaster exercises in practice.

Early systems functioned under close human supervision, effectively limited to executing preprogrammed tasks. However, as exploration moves to regions where communication is ineffective or unviable, robots will need to carry out complex tasks without human supervision. To enable such capabilities, robots are being enhanced by advances ranging from new sensor development to automated mission planning software, distributed robotic control, and more efficient power systems. As robotics technology becomes simultaneously more capable and economically viable, individual robots operated at large expense by teams of experts are increasingly supplemented by teams of robots used cooperatively under minimal human supervision.},

abstract="Disasters have become an issue of growing concern throughout the world, whether it is natural hazards or through human factors. The frequency, as well as magnitude, of disasters threatening large population living in diverse environments is increasing in recent years across the world. These disasters also have far-reaching implications on sustainable development through social, economic and environmental impacts. It is highly imperative to develop effective tools for disaster management. Remote sensing systems have been playing a great role in disaster management in such areas as flooding, cyclones, drought, earthquake and tsunami. Satellite remote sensing is largely adopted due to its cost effectiveness, short temporal orbiting and large area of coverage. Remote sensing technologies have been used in disaster management especially during the preparedness/warning and response/monitoring stages. Despite the capabilities of remote sensing technologies in natural and human disaster management, there are still some limitations in its deployment due to the divide between developed and developing countries, data accessibility (especially high resolution imagery) and technological limitations. This paper examines the recent developments in the application of remote sensing in disaster management such as the proliferation of data through unprecedented sources (Google Earth, crowdsourcing, Global Land Cover) and improvement in data resolutions and integration of technologies. It examines how recent developments can help in overcoming the limitations of using remotely sensed data in disaster management. There is a need for more collaborative and interdisciplinary frameworks to fully utilize the capabilities of remote sensing in hazard and disaster management."

These rules are written to train and guide safe human operation of marine vehicles and are heavily dependent on human common sense in determining rule applicability as well as rule execution, especially when multiple rules apply simultaneously. To capture the flexibility exploited by humans, this work applies a novel method of multi-objective optimization, interval programming, in a behavior-based control framework for representing the navigation rules, as well as task behaviors, in a way that achieves simultaneous optimal satisfaction. We present experimental validation of this approach using multiple autonomous surface craft. This work represents the first in-field demonstration of multiobjective optimization applied to autonomous COLREGS-based marine vehicle navigation},

Experiments were conducted using a model-referenced trajectory planner, which was implemented on unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) of different size, thrust, and maneuverability characteristics. The planner combines a local search based on the Velocity Obstacles (VO) concept with a global, lattice-based search for a dynamically feasible trajectory (determined using models of the nonlinear dynamics, nonholonomic constraints, and low-level control of each system). Multiple low-level USV heading and speed controllers, varying in complexity from proportional control to nonlinear backstepping control, were tested with the planner. High planning performance is achieved by searching within a resolution-adaptive space of the USV׳s candidate motion goals. Sampling is constrained to ensure that the International Regulations for the Prevention of Collisions at Sea (COLREGs) are followed. Prior to on-water implementation, the system was fine-tuned in simulation. Four automatically-generated USV behaviors were demonstrated in on-water tests within a complex, static obstacle field: 1) Approach (USV approaches a fixed target); 2) Follow (USV approaches a moving target); 3) Single COLREGs-Compliant Crossing (USV approaches a fixed target while avoiding another vessel); and 4) Multiple COLREGs-Compliant Crossings (USV approaches a fixed target while avoiding an interference vessel multiple times)."

In both cases, the modular vehicle software infrastructures are based around the open-source LCM software library for low-latency, real-time message passing. To elucidate the real-world application of LCM in marine robotic systems, we present the software architecture of these two successful marine robotic applications and illustrate the capabilities and flexibilities of this approach to real-time marine robotics. We present benchmarking test results comparing the throughput of LCM with the Mission-Oriented Operating Suite, another robot software system popular in marine robotics. Experimental results demonstrate the capacity of the LCM framework to make large amounts of actionable information available to the operator and to allow for distributed supervisory control.

The EMILY project aims to team an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to augment the search and rescue of marine casualties during an emergency response phase. The USV is designed to serve as a flotation device once it reaches the victims. A live video feed from the UAV is provided to the casuality responders giving them a visual estimate of the USVs orientation and position to help with its navigation. One of the challenges involved with casualty response using a USV UAV team is to simultaneously control the USV and track it. In this paper, we present an implemented solution to automate the UAV camera movements to keep the USV in view at all times. The motor schema proposed, uses the USVs coordinates from the visual localization subsystem to control the UAVs camera movements and track the USV with minimal camera movements such that the USV is always in the cameras field of view.},

abstract={ Purpose – This paper aims to discuss search and rescue (SAR) and disaster relief robot developments, trials and applications and to answer the question posed in the title. Design/methodology/approach – Following a short introduction, this first describes Integrated Components for Assisted Rescue and Unmanned Search operations, a recent, collaborative, European research project, and euRathlon, a major robotics competition. It then highlights the role of the centre for robot-assisted search and rescue, and provides examples of the deployment of terrestrial, marine and airborne robots in real SAR and disaster relief situations. It concludes with a brief discussion. Findings – This shows that SAR and disaster relief robots are the topic of an extensive development effort, and many have performed well in simulated disaster scenarios. Terrestrial, marine and airborne robots have been used in many real disaster relief situations since 2001, and the use of unmanned aerial vehicles has proliferated due to recent technological developments. Robots now play an important role in supporting SAR teams, and this will certainly increase as the technologies are developed further. Originality/value – In an era characterized by extreme weather events and continuing military conflicts, robots play an increasingly important role in supporting human disaster response teams. This article provides details of developments, trials and real-world deployments of such robots.}

abstract="A consequence of the growing number of empirical studies in software engineering is the need to adopt systematic approaches to assessing and aggregating research outcomes in order to provide a balanced and objective summary of research evidence for a particular topic. The paper reports experiences with applying one such approach, the practice of systematic literature review, to the published studies relevant to topics within the software engineering domain. The systematic literature review process is summarised, a number of reviews being undertaken by the authors and others are described and some lessons about the applicability of this practice to software engineering are extracted. The basic systematic literature review process seems appropriate to software engineering and the preparation and validation of a review protocol in advance of a review activity is especially valuable. The paper highlights areas where some adaptation of the process to accommodate the domain-specific characteristics of software engineering is needed as well as areas where improvements to current software engineering infrastructure and practices would enhance its applicability. In particular, infrastructure support provided by software engineering indexing databases is inadequate. Also, the quality of abstracts is poor; it is usually not possible to judge the relevance of a study from a review of the abstract alone. "

This control aspect is essential in order to effectively perform emergency ship towing operations. In particular, these robots coordinate their motion, with the aim of performing an autonomous tying operation, linking the messenger line of a distressed ship to a salvage tugboat. Automatic guidance algorithms are developed in order to provide cooperation and coordination of robots' motion, in such a way to perform the knotting maneuver between the two employed vehicles. In particular, the major contribution of the present work in terms of adaptive control methodology consists in extending a well-known path following strategy for multi-vehicle cooperation to cope with moving reference paths. Extensive experimental testing validates the proposed concept, also pointing out the feasibility and effectiveness of the developed system in real-case scenarios.},

abstract={Effective human-robot interaction in urban search and rescue robotics currently requires a minimum 2:1 human-to-robot ratio. The demands are not just physical (though the task at present is facilitated by having a second person assist with physical robot operations); cognitive challenges are presented by the key-hole effect, teleproprioception and telekinesthesis. In studies with 2:1 robot teams, operators who talked more with their teammates about the search environment, the robot's situatedness in that environment, and search strategies seemed to develop a shared mental model of both the search environment and the task at hand. Moreover, operators who talked more about goal-directed aspects of the search task with their teammates were rated as having better situation awareness and task performance. Effective teams were nine times more likely to find victims in search exercises. This suggests that robot-assisted search and rescue is a team task and good human-robot interaction is critical to performance.},

This article examines operator situation awareness and technical search team interaction using communication analysis. It analyzes situation awareness, team communication, and the interaction of these constructs using a systematic coding scheme designed for this research. The findings indicate that operators spent significantly more time gathering information about the state of the robot and the state of the environment than they did navigating the robot. Operators had difficulty integrating the robot's view into their understanding of the search and rescue site. They compensated for this lack of situation awareness by communicating with team members at the site, attempting to gather information that would provide a more complete mental model of the site. They also worked with team members to develop search strategies. The article concludes with suggestions for design and future research. }

The comparison is based on experimental results and the cross track error measurements as well as the servo command signals are considered in the analysis. Both the guidance schemes are applied to the underactuated LAUV vehicle in the same environmental conditions with the same speed and heading controllers. The comparison separates between transient and steady-state behaviour, with focus on the latter. In particular, the cross-track error transfer functions for small time varying disturbances are derived for the two guidance schemes at equilibrium and similarities are found with the experimental results. The analysis concludes good path following performance for both the VF and the ILOS guidance laws, with the VF controller performing slightly better. However, the VF guidance scheme suffers from significant chattering on the horizontal rudders while the ILOS guidance law gives very smooth servo commands."

abstract={This paper presents an extensive analysis of the integral line-of-sight (ILOS) guidance method for path-following tasks of underactuated marine vehicles, operating on and below the sea surface. It is shown that due to the embedded integral action, the guidance law makes the vessels follow straight lines by compensating for the drift effect of environmental disturbances, such as currents, wind, and waves. The ILOS guidance is first applied to a 2-D model of surface vessels that includes the underactauted sway dynamics of the vehicle as well as disturbances in the form of constant irrotational ocean currents and constant dynamic, attitude dependent, and forces. The actuated dynamics are not considered at this point. A Lyapunov closed-loop analysis yields explicit bounds on the guidance law gains to guarantee uniform global asymptotic stability (UGAS) and uniform local exponential stability (ULES). The complete kinematic and dynamic closed-loop system of the 3-D ILOS guidance law is analyzed in the following and hence extending the analysis to underactuated autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) for the 3-D straight-line path-following applications in the presence of constant irrotational ocean currents. The actuated surge, pitch, and yaw dynamics are included in the analysis where the closed-loop system forms a cascade, and the properties of UGAS and ULES are shown. The 3-D ILOS control system is a generalization of the 2-D ILOS guidance. Finally, results from simulations and experiments are presented to validate and illustrate the theoretical results, where the 2-D ILOS guidance is applied to the cooperative autonomous robotics towing system vehicle and light AUV.},

abstract={Search and rescue (SAR) is a challenging application for autonomous robotics research. The requirements of this kind of application are very demanding and are still far from being met. One of the most compelling requirements is the capability of robots to adapt their functionalities to harsh and heterogeneous environments. In order to meet this requirement, it is common to embed contextual knowledge into robotic modules. We have previously developed a context-based architecture that decouples contextual knowledge, and its use, from typical robotic functionalities. In this paper, we show how it is possible to use this approach to enhance the performance of a robotic system involved in SAR missions. In particular, we provide a case study on exploration and victim detection tasks, specifically tailored to a given SAR mission. Moreover, we extend our contextual knowledge formalism in order to manage complex rules that deal with spatial and temporal aspects that are needed to model mission requirements. The approach has been validated through several experiments that show the effectiveness of the presented methodology for SAR. © 2009 VSP.},

abstract={Routine operations at sea such as environmental monitoring and security patrols involve substantial long-term
costs in terms of equipment and labor. Moreover, operating in hazardous conditions or during severe weather increases the probability of mission failure and in some cases endangers human lives. Recent advances in unmanned surface vehicle (USV) technologies show considerable promise in alleviating some of the dirty, dull and dangerous work required in maritime industry, ocean research, and law enforcement. In particular, aquatic surface drones like the Wave Adaptive Modular-Vessel (WAM-V) have the potential to serve as robust and highly scalable operational support vessels to rapidly characterize offshore threats from oil spills, hazardous chemical leaks and radioactive outfall. This manuscript describes the integration of a Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosives (CBRNE) sensor system with a remotely operated USV capable of transmitting real-time contamination measurements, video streams, and ancillary data to off-site incident commanders. Results from sea trials, simulations, and tactical operations guide discussion of the navigation, control and telemetry design elements applicable for configuring USV – environmental monitoring platforms capable of enhancing situational awareness for high-risk response and recovery efforts in the marine domain.},

abstract="In recent years unmanned vehicles have grown in popularity, with an ever increasing number of applications in industry, the military and research within air, ground and marine domains. In particular, the challenges posed by unmanned marine vehicles in order to increase the level of autonomy include automatic obstacle avoidance and conformance with the Rules of the Road when navigating in the presence of other maritime traffic. The \{USV\} Master Plan which has been established for the \{US\} Navy outlines a list of objectives for improving autonomy in order to increase mission diversity and reduce the amount of supervisory intervention. This paper addresses the specific development needs based on notable research carried out to date, primarily with regard to navigation, guidance, control and motion planning. The integration of the International Regulations for Avoiding Collisions at Sea within the obstacle avoidance protocols seeks to prevent maritime accidents attributed to human error. The addition of these critical safety measures may be key to a future growth in demand for USVs, as they serve to pave the way for establishing legal policies for unmanned vessels. "

Due to the desire for improved autonomy and thus reduced human interaction, it is essential to incorporate vessel avoidance protocols into the ODA architecture for operation amongst maritime traffic, implementing the marine Rules of the Road.

Unfortunately, their usability is severely constrained by the lack of a reliable obstacle detection and avoidance system. In this article, one such experimental platform is proposed, which performs obstacle detection, risk assessment and path planning (avoidance) tasks autonomously in an integrated manner. The detection system is based on a vision-LIDAR (light detection and ranging) system, whereas a heuristic path planner is utilised. A unique property of the path planner is its compliance with the marine collision regulations. It is demonstrated through hardware-in-the-loop simulations that the proposed system can be useful for both uninhabited and manned vessels. }

This paper extends previous work characterizing robot failures by including recent data and organizing failures according to a novel taxonomy , which includes human failures. Failure type and frequency data were collected from 15 robots representing three manufacturers and seven models over a period of three years, in a variety of environments. Standard manufacturing measures for product reliability were used. The results show that overall MTBF and availability have improved since the previous analysis but are still low. The MTBF across all robot types was 24 hours and availability was 54%. The control system was the most common source of failures (32%), followed by the mechanical platform. Statistical analysis shows that the time between failures, time to repair, and downtime vary widely. For this reason the means reported here are not reliable predictors for future failures, but still provide information on the overall frequency and consequences of mobile robot failures.},

The results of this work impact the field of robotics by providing a case study for HRI in USAR drawn from an unstaged USAR effort. Eleven recommendations are made based on the findings that impact the robotics, computer science, engineering, psychology, and rescue fields.

abstract={Tidal rivers and accompanying coastal environments represent critical links between the open estuary and the local tributary and watershed. In Florida, these coastal ecosystems are multi-use systems. They are often a primary source of water for agricultural, industrial, and human consumption all while functioning as commercial and recreational shipping thoroughfares and receiving storm water runoff and NPDES discharges. In addition to their importance for those direct human uses, their quality and characteristics directly affect the spawning, nursery, and juvenile habitats for numerous commercial and sport fisheries. Thus monitoring and assessment, especially identifying spatial patterns or trends in water chemistry (e.g. temperature, conductivity, salinity, turbidity, chlorophyll, dissolved organic matter and dissolved gasses), of these tidal environments can represent a complex sampling and analysis challenge. There is a perception that sampling and analyzing parameters at regularly spaced intervals over the surface area of a river system will be representative of general trends. However, standard sampling strategy assumes both that parameters will change in a consistent longitudinal and downstream manner and that the average of a parameter is the level where negative impacts occur. Using an innovative combination of unmanned surface vehicles (US V) and geospatial analytical techniques, we will show that this perception is not an entirely accurate or complete view.},

abstract="Abstract Anthropogenic input of carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere and its uptake by the ocean with associated changes in ocean chemistry have created an urgent need to expand coverage of sea surface and atmospheric carbon dioxide observations. Conventional sampling platforms (e.g. ships and moorings) do not provide the spatial and temporal resolution needed to assess the effects of rapidly changing carbon dioxide conditions and are expensive to operate. Through a series of deployments beginning in March 2012, two versions of the Wave Glider autonomous surface vehicles from Liquid Robotics, Inc. have been instrumented with sensors to measure pH, partial pressure of \{CO2\} (pCO2) of the atmosphere and sea surface, and wind speed and direction, from which instantaneous sea-air fluxes of \{CO2\} can be calculated. These deployments, most near Monterey Bay, California, were highly correlated with ΔpCO2 measurements obtained from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's (MBARI) long-term mooring station M1, as well as from shipboard observations. In the central California upwelling system with highly variable pCO2 levels, the gliders captured large spatial gradients associated with upwelling fronts. Differences in sea surface pCO2 as large as 470 μatm over &lt; 0.5 km were observed. Unlike traditional ship sampling methods, however, this new generation of sampling platforms is capable of continuous long-term (months) deployments at a fraction of the cost. The vehicles thus have the potential of filling important gaps in present understanding of the effects of global change on ocean chemistry. "

abstract={Within the EU FP7 project “Cognitive autonomous diving buddy (CADDY)”, work has been made to assist and monitor divers through Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) during their long underwater expeditions. To achieve this goal, one milestone is to give the AUV the capability to track the diver's whereabouts at all times. Inertial sensors are mounted on the diver's body to transmit acoustically his relative position and orientation to the AUV using an Ultra-Short Baseline (USBL) system. However, the acoustic system is prone to give erroneous data depending on the surrounding geography, modems alignment and sensors calibration, plus its low transmission rate does not allow real time performance. To overcome these drawbacks and complement the acoustic set-up, this paper presents a general framework to detect and estimate the diver's body pose based on generated point clouds from a stereo camera. Our method is based on a Long Short-Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM-RNN) that captures the temporal relations between global point cloud descriptors as they change with the diver movements. Since the analysis is made on time sequences rather than on one-shot visual information, the framework is robust against the distortions and poor quality typical in underwater while still providing real time performance. We focus on the description of the image-processing and LSTM-RNN pipeline, as well on its validation with a dataset created during several field trial experiments.},

Different types of AUVs are being used for applications ranging from ocean exploration to coastal tactical surveillance. These AUVs generally follow a predictable trajectory specified by the mission requirements. Inaccuracies in models for deriving position estimates and the drift caused by ocean currents, however, lead to uncertainty when estimating an AUV's position. In this article, two forms of position uncertainty - internal and external - are studied, which are the position uncertainty associated with a particular AUV as seen by itself and that as seen by others, respectively. Then, a statistical model to estimate the internal uncertainty for a general AUV is proposed. Based on this model, a novel mathematical framework using Unscented Kalman Filtering is developed to estimate the external uncertainty. Finally, the benefits of this framework for several location-sensitive applications are shown via emulations.},

abstract="Oil spills produced by accidents from oil tankers and blowouts of oil and gas from offshore platforms cause tremendous damage to the environment as well as to marine and human life. To prevent oil and gas that are accidentally released from deep water from spreading and causing further damage to the environment over time, early detection and monitoring systems can be deployed to the area where underwater releases of the oil and gas first occurred. Monitoring systems can provide a rapid inspection of the area by detecting chemical substances and collecting oceanographic data necessary for enhancing the accuracy of simulation of behavior of oil and gas. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) called the spilled oil and gas tracking autonomous buoy system (SOTAB-I) has been developed to perform on-site measurements of oceanographic data as well as dissolved chemical substances using underwater mass spectrometry. In this chapter, the outlines of SOTAB-I and a description of its hardware and software are presented. The operating modes and guidance and control of the robot are detailed. The experimental results obtained during the early deployments of SOTAB-I in the shallow water of the Gulf of Mexico in the USA demonstrated the ability of SOTAB-I to collect substances’ dissolutions in seawater such as hydrocarbons. Deepwater experiments were conducted in Toyama Bay in Japan and enabled demonstration of the ability of SOTAB-I to establish the vertical water column distribution of oceanographic data, such as temperature, salinity, and density. In addition, a high-resolution profile of water currents was obtainable.",

abstract={Seafloor networks of cables, pipelines, and other infrastructure underpin our daily lives, providing communication links, information, and energy supplies. Despite their global importance, these networks are vulnerable to damage by a number of natural seafloor hazards, including landslides, turbidity currents, fluid flow, and scour. Conventional geophysical techniques, such as high-resolution reflection seismic and side-scan sonar, are commonly employed in geohazard assessments. These conventional tools provide essential information for route planning and design; however, such surveys provide only indirect evidence of past processes and do not observe or measure the geohazard itself. As such, many numerical-based impact models lack field-scale calibration, and much uncertainty exists about the triggers, nature, and frequency of deep-water geohazards. Recent advances in technology now enable a step change in their understanding through direct monitoring. We outline some emerging monitoring tools and how they can quantify key parameters for deepwater geohazard assessment. Repeat seafloor surveys in dynamic areas show that solely relying on evidence from past deposits can lead to an under-representation of the geohazard events. Acoustic Doppler current profiling provides new insights into the structure of turbidity currents, whereas instrumented mobile sensors record the nature of movement at the base of those flows for the first time. Existing and bespoke cabled networks enable high bandwidth, low power, and distributed measurements of parameters such as strain across large areas of seafloor. These techniques provide valuable new measurements that will improve geohazard assessments and should be deployed in a complementary manner alongside conventional geophysical tools.},

booktitle={29th International Conference on Ocean, Offshore and Arctic Engineering},
Abstract={Crew safety is a key parameter for any seagoing mission. Although today’s standards are high, occasionally people go overboard while working on deck. In this case the probability of survival remains low. The joint research project “AGaPaS” [1] aims to significantly increase the chances of survival for a drifting person. Its main objective is to develop a self activating, partially autonomously operating rescue system, able to search, find and rescue people gone overboard. A crucial part of the system is a remotely operated vessel, which is released by free fall from a mother ship. This paper focuses on the hull optimization of this rescue vessel, considering various aspects. The rescue operability has first priority and leads to numerous system specifications such as main dimensions. In addition, adequate seakeeping behaviour is a prerequisite for the successful recovery of a person in distress. This includes small relative motions between the vessel and the drifting person. Moreover, the vessel’s free fall characteristics are to be analyzed. Here, particular interest has been laid on the reduction of the peak acceleration as well as on transferring the vertical velocity into a horizontal motion, in order to minimize the risk of a collision with the mother ship. Various hull geometries have been investigated by means of numerical methods as well as model tests leading to the final hull design of the unmanned AGaPaS rescue vessel.},

Abstract={The joint research project “AGaPaS” (Autonomous Galileo-supported Rescue Vessel for Persons overboard) aims to significantly raise the chances of survival for people who have gone overboard. Its main objective is to develop a self activating, partially autonomously operating rescue system, able to search, find and rescue a drifting person [1]. A crucial part of the system is a remotely operated vessel, which is released by free fall from a mother ship. This type of launch offers a minimum response time but comes with the disadvantage of high loads for the rescue vessel and its equipment. A particular challenge is posed by the catamaran shaped hull, being dropped from a cruising ship. The goal is to find an optimum in the occurring accelerations and pressure loads applied to the hull. While the pressure loads have a direct impact on the strength of the hull, the accelerations mainly affect the boat equipment and its mountings. The hull optimization has already been conducted [2], therefore, this publication focuses on the identification of favourable launch parameters. Within the scope of this investigation crucial parameters such as cruise speed, drop height and launch angle are varied. All free falls are analyzed by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), whereas selected cases are validated by experimental data.},

The distinctive characteristic of the vehicle, that is realized with commercial components, is that of being propelled by an outboard, steering electric motor. The main task the control system has to perform is that of keeping the ASV within a given range from a moving target, using position information. This ability is necessary in order to ensure that the ASV can act autonomously as supply vessel of a microROV it carries and can deploy. Emphasis is on the definition of a suitable control architecture, that matches the dynamics of the ASV and takes into account the fact that the system is underactuated. Performances are investigated by means of suitable simulations."

In particular, the simulators selected are reviewed for their suitability for the simulation of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), as well as their suitability for the simulation of multi-vehicle operations. The criteria for selection are based on the following features: sufficient physical fidelity to allow modelling of manipulators and end effectors; a programmatic interface, via scripting or middleware; modelling of optical and/or acoustic sensors; adequate documentation; previous use in academic research. A subset of the selected simulators are reviewed in greater detail; these are UWSim, MORSE, and Gazebo. This subset of simulators allow virtual sensors to be simulated, such as GPS, sonar, and multibeam sonar making them suitable for the design and simulation of navigation and mission planning algorithms. We conclude that simulation for underwater vehicles remains a niche problem, but with some additional effort researchers wishing to simulate such vehicles may do so, basing their work on existing software.},

abstract={This paper addresses the issue of data-driven online velocity optimization of an autonomous sailboat. Autonomous sailboats represent an ideal for long range and duration reconnaissance missions. Sailboat control is a challenging control task; sailboats are characterized by a number of control variables, all of which affect the ship trajectory and state in a highly nonlinear fashion. In this paper, a path-following automatic sailboat controller is presented. The control system has two main components: a heading control, acting on the rudder, and a velocity optimizer, acting on the sails. The optimizer is based on a modified extremum seeking approach. This paper also derives a first-principle-based 4 DoF sailboat model that is experimentally validated and used to guide the design and tuning of the control system. In fact, the control system is first tuned and validated in simulation. The simulation environment enables the comparison of the proposed model against a theoretical benchmark and a state-of-the-art controller. The analysis reveals that the proposed control system achieves near-optimal performance and considerably outperforms the state-of-the-art solution. Finally, the controller is tested and validated on an instrumented scale model.},

abstract={This paper describes results and findings from a recent two month robotic surface seep monitoring mission in the north-eastern Gulf of Mexico. The studied sites are at Mississippi Canyon salt domes and mud volcanoes which have well known natural seepage, resulting in the existence of regular but short-lived surface oil slicks. Effective real-time monitoring of such phenomenon requires new in situ technology that is capable of long term persistent surveillance and robust autonomous hydrocarbon detection. The core component of this mission was the Wave Glider autonomous marine vehicle integrated with a multi-channel optical sensor payload and weather sensing instrumentation package. A statistical process control (SPC) based automatic hydrocarbon event detection algorithm was also further developed and demonstrated during the mission.
The paper also includes results describing the Wave Glider multi-sensor signatures to known hydrocarbon concentrations in typical marine elastic and inelastic scattering background environments. A series of experiments were independently conducted in both controlled laboratory conditions and also in a controlled spill facility, with ground truth spectrofluorometry and water sampling analytics results also being obtained. The event detection algorithmic approach was tested and refined using data from these sets of experiments, as well as the data acquired during the field mission. The algorithm was executed with near real-time Wave Glider data during the second month of the mission and results demonstrate that robust real-time surface hydrocarbon detection is possible and can be used to reconfigure the Wave Glider behavior, converting from a surveillance mode to a survey or mapping mode in order to determine the boundaries and origin of the identified surface slicks. To further corroborate with the in situ results, coincident SAR imagery collects were made at certain phases of the mission to assist with the analysis of the multi-sensor signatures, slick lifetime and spatial extent as derived by the Wave Glider measurements.}

abstract="Abstract Reliability and safety of engineered systems often extends to a system composed of autonomous and heterogeneous systems. Systems integration enables formation of larger system of systems with greater, encompassing scope and goals. Nuclear power station reliability and safety involves an extensive system of systems. Failures at Chernobyl and Fukushima underscore the rare but catastrophic ripple-effect of a failed system within a system of systems conceptual model. Modeling and simulation of systems with various sffcenarios increases confidence in conceptual models, particularly scenarios that are too costly or risky to assess by other means. This research implements a system of systems conceptual model of a notional Fukishima-like disaster using a Live-Virtual-Constructive simulation framework. Focusing on a conceptual model involving an unmanned aerial system intervention, the research illustrates the framework's utility and effectiveness for assessing system reliability and safety within the conceptual model. Novel use of a screening experiment demonstrates the framework's capability to rapidly identify critical factors and their significance. A framework encompassing live, virtual, and constructive simulations provides a generalized capability to compose, simulate, and evaluate from multiple perspectives the suitability of various systems and conceptual models to accomplish a broad range of emergency response missions including the one investigated here.

abstract={The research objective is to develop an automated robotic system that will enable safe and cost-effective underwater inspection of bridge substructures. The system concept being developed is a semiautonomous robotic system that can carry a sensor platform underwater to detect scour, deterioration, or damage to support columns. It provides positional data and sensor information (video images) to the system operator; these can be verbally annotated while being recorded. The operator initiates basic commands and transmits them to the underwater apparatus. On-board microprocessor-based controllers automatically accomplish the detailed control. The primary underwater apparatus has a team of two identical mobile robots designed to travel along opposite surfaces of the pier while connected to each another by a cable and winch system. Each robot has rubber tracks or wheels with cleats and is driven by internal motors. Tensioning the cables that connect the two robots provides traction. The robots can move both vertically and horizontally. While each robot operates its own drive motors and cable winches, coordination of movement and cable tensioning occurs automatically through feedback between the robots and the control console. Multiple robots, evenly spaced around a support column, may inspect larger structures},

abstract={Earth science research must bridge the gap between the atmosphere and the ocean to foster understanding of Earth's climate and ecology. Typical ocean sensing is done with satellites or in situ buoys and research ships which are slow to reposition. Cloud cover inhibits study of localized transient phenomena such as Harmful Algal Blooms (HAB). A fleet of extended-deployment surface autonomous vehicles will enable in situ study of characteristics of HAB, coastal pollutants, and related phenomena. We have developed a multiplatform telesupervision architecture that supports adaptive reconfiguration based on environmental sensor inputs. Our system allows the autonomous repositioning of smart sensors for HAB study by networking a fleet of NOAA OASIS (Ocean Atmosphere Sensor Integration System) surface autonomous vehicles. In situ measurements intelligently modify the search for areas of high concentration. Inference Grid and complementary information-theoretic techniques support sensor fusion and analysis. Telesupervision supports sliding autonomy from high-level mission tasking, through vehicle and data monitoring, to teleoperation when direct human interaction is appropriate. This paper reports on experimental results from multi-platform tests conducted in the Chesapeake Bay and in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania waters using OASIS platforms, autonomous kayaks, and multiple simulated platforms to conduct cooperative sensing of chlorophyll-a and water quality.},

abstract={Infragravity waves can be observed at the 1000 m deep ocean bottom broadband seismic station MOBB on stormy as well as quiet days. When compared to the energy of the short-period ocean waves recorded at the local buoys, infragravity waves in the longer than 20 s period band are found to be mainly locally generated from shorter-period waves. Two types of modulation of the infragravity signal are observed. First, the entire infragravity band signal is modulated in-phase with tides, possibly as a result of the nonlinear exchange of energy between the short-period waves and tidal currents. Second, a longer-period modulation of the infragravity signal is observed and is best correlated with the energy of the 14 s period ocean waves. This correlation indicates that the mechanism of generation of double frequency microseisms and infragravity waves are likely strongly related. Previously recorded data during the Oregon ULF/VLF experiment at 600 m water depth also indicate that infragravity waves are primarily locally generated.},

  abstract={In the event of a large crisis (think about typhoon Haiyan or the Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan), a primordial task of the rescue services is the search for human survivors on the incident site. This is a complex and dangerous task, which often leads to loss of lives among the human crisis managers themselves. The introduction of unmanned search and rescue devices can offer a valuable tool to save human lives and to speed up the search and rescue process. In this context, the EU-FP7-ICARUS project [1] concentrates on the development of unmanned search and rescue technologies for detecting, locating and rescuing humans.A main factor which explains why there is so little robotic technology applied on the terrain in real-life search and rescue operations, is that the complex nature and difficult operating conditions of search and rescue operations pose heavy constraints on the mechanical design of the unmanned platforms. In this paper, we discuss the different user requirements which have an impact of the design of the mechanical systems (air, ground and marine robots). We show how these user requirements are obtained, how they are validated, how they lead to design specifications for operational prototypes which are tested in realistic operational conditions and we show how the final mechanical design specifications are derived from these different steps. An important aspect of all these design steps which is emphasized in this paper is to always keep the end-users (in this case the search and rescue workers) in the loop in order to come to realistic requirements and mechanical design specifications, ensuring the practical deployability [2] of the developed platforms.}

abstract={Automated environmental monitoring in marine environments is currently carried out either by small-scale robotic systems, composed of one or few robots, or static sensor networks. In this paper, we propose the use of swarm robotics systems to carry out marine environmental monitoring missions. In swarm robotics systems, each individual unit is relatively simple and inexpensive. The robots rely on decentralized control and local communication, allowing the swarm to scale to hundreds of units and to cover large areas. We study the application of a swarm of aquatic robots to environmental monitoring tasks. In the first part of the study, we synthesize swarm control for a temperature monitoring mission and validate our results with a real swarm robotics system. Then, we conduct a simulation-based evaluation of the robots' performance over large areas and with large swarm sizes, and demonstrate the swarm's robustness to faults. Our results show that swarm robotics systems are suited for environmental monitoring tasks by efficiently covering a target area, allowing for redundancy in the data collection process, and tolerating individual robot faults.},

This project aims to assist responders with establishing contact with drowning victims as quickly as possible through the use of a 1.3-meter autonomous unmanned surface vehicle (USV). Once victims are reached, the device can serve as a flotation device to support them. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) provides a live video feed to responders and aids USV's navigation by visually estimating the USV's position and orientation. The movement of the UAV and the USV along with varying lighting, distance, and perspective make the task of estimating USV's position and orientation challenging. We present two implemented solutions for reliable visual localization, the first relying on color thresholding and contour detection, and the second using histograms, back-projection, and CamShift algorithm. The visual localization system was validated in four proof-of-concept field trials. Other unsuccessful methods are discussed.},

year={2017},
volume={},

pages={116-122},
abstract={This paper proposes a method for visual pose stabilization of Fotokite, a tethered small unmanned aerial system, using a forward facing monocular camera. Conventionally, Fotokite stabilizes itself only relative to its tether and not relative to the global frame. It is, therefore, susceptible to environmental disturbances (especially wind) or motion of its ground station. Related work proposed visual stabilization for unmanned aerial systems using a downward facing camera and homography estimation. The major disadvantage of this approach is that all the features used in the homography estimation must be in the same plane. The method proposed in this paper works for features in different planes and can be used with a forward-facing camera. This paper is the part of a bigger project on saving drowning victims using lifesaving unmanned surface vehicle visually servoed by Fotokite to reach the victims. Some of the used algorithms are motion sensitive and, therefore, it is desirable for Fotokite to keep its pose relative to the world. The method presented in this paper will enable to prevent gradual drifting of Fotokite in windy conditions typical for coastal areas or when the ground station is on a boat. The quality of pose stabilization was quantitatively analyzed in 9 trials by measuring metric displacement from the initial pose. The achieved mean metric displacement was 34 cm. The results were also compared to 3 trials with no stabilization.},

abstract={This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the problem of visual navigation of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) using visual feedback from a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) in drowning victim recovery scenario. Manually teleoperated life-saving USVs have been used by responders to assist drowning victims. However, the teleoperation is difficult and requires additional manpower. In this project, the rescue is automated by using a sUAS to navigate the USV to the victims autonomously. This enables the responders to focus on the actual rescue. In this paper, the focus is given to the theory behind the problem. The problem is divided into visual position estimation, visual orientation estimation, and motion planning subproblems. For each subproblem, a theoretical analysis is provided and lower bound limits on how well the subproblem can be solved are determined. This will help to understand the theoretical limitations and to drive further research. Lastly, the previously published system is compared with the lower bound limits to identify the areas of potential improvement.},

abstract={Accurately quantifying total greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., methane) from natural systems such as lakes, reservoirs, and wetlands requires the spatial and temporal measurement of both diffusive and ebullitive (bubbling) emissions. Ebullitive emissions exhibit high spatial and temporal variability and as such are difficult to measure. Traditional manual measurement techniques provide only limited localized assessment of methane flux, often introducing significant errors when extrapolated to the whole-of-system. This is further exacerbated when whole-of-region estimates are developed for inclusion in global greenhouse gas inventories. In this paper, we directly address these current sampling limitations by comparing two robot boat-based sampling systems with complementary sensing modalities to directly measure in real time the spatiotemporal release of methane to atmosphere across inland waterways. The first system consists of a single Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV) fitted with an Optical Methane Detector with algorithms to exploit the robot's mobility and transect repeatability for the accurate detection and quantification of methane bubbles across whole-of-system. The second system consists of multiple networked ASVs capable of persistent operation and scalable to whole-of-region monitoring. Each ASV carries a novel automated chamber-based gas sampling system to allow simultaneous real-time measurement of methane across the waterway. These ASV systems provide a foundation for persistent large-scale spatiotemporal sampling allowing scientists to develop whole-of-region greenhouse gas estimates and greatly improve global inventory budgets. An overview of the single and multi-robot sampling systems is presented, including their automated methane detection and sampling methodologies for the spatiotemporal quantification of greenhouse gas release to atmosphere. Experimental results are shown demonstrating each system's ability to autonomously navigate, detect, and quantify methane release to atmosphere across an entire inland reservoir.},

MORSE uses a “Software-in-the-Loop” philosophy, i.e. it gives the possibility to evaluate the algorithms embedded in the software architecture of the robot within which they are to be integrated. Still, MORSE is independent of any robot architecture or communication framework (middleware). MORSE is built on top of Blender, using its powerful features and extending its functionality through Python scripts. Simulations are executed on Blender's Game Engine mode, which provides a realistic graphical display of the simulated environments and allows exploiting the reputed Bullet physics engine.

abstract={Earth science research must bridge the gap between the atmosphere and the ocean to foster understanding of Earth's climate and ecology. Ocean sensing is typically done with satellites, buoys, and crewed research ships. The limitations of these systems include the fact that satellites are often blocked by cloud cover, and buoys and ships have spatial coverage limitations. This paper describes a Multilevel Autonomy Robot Telesupervision Architecture (MARTA) for multi-robot science exploration, and an embodiment of the MARTA architecture in a real-world system called the Telesupervised Adaptive Ocean Sensor Fleet (TAOSF). TAOSF supervises and coordinates a group of robotic boats, the OASIS platforms, to enable in-situ study of phenomena in the ocean/atmosphere interface, as well as on the ocean surface and sub-surface. The OASIS platforms are extended- deployment autonomous ocean surface vehicles, whose development is funded separately by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). TAOSF allows a human operator to effectively supervise and coordinate multiple robotic assets using the MARTA multi-level autonomy control architecture, where the operating mode of the vessels ranges from autonomous control to teleoperated human control. TAOSF increases data-gathering effectiveness and science return while reducing demands on scientists for robotic asset tasking, control, and monitoring. The first field application chosen for TAOSF is the characterization of Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs). We discuss the overall TAOSF system and the underlying MARTA architecture, describe field tests conducted under controlled conditions using rhodamine dye as a HAB simulant, present initial results from these tests, and outline the next steps in the development of TAOSF.},

 abstract={The highly successful architecture and protocols of today's Internet may operate poorly in environments characterized by very long delay paths and frequent network partitions. These problems are exacerbated by end nodes with limited power or memory resources. Often deployed in mobile and extreme environments lacking continuous connectivity, many such networks have their own specialized protocols, and do not utilize IP. To achieve interoperability between them, we propose a network architecture and application interface structured around optionally-reliable asynchronous message forwarding, with limited expectations of end-to-end connectivity and node resources. The architecture operates as an overlay above the transport layers of the networks it interconnects, and provides key services such as in-network data storage and retransmission, interoperable naming, authenticated forwarding and a coarse-grained class of service.},

In this paper we study the robustness of the controller in a robot simulator, and evaluate it's performance in a realistic environmental model setup. A probabilistic Lagrangian environmental model is used that can capture both the time-averaged, idealized structure and the instantaneous, realistic structure of a dynamic plume. The controller is implemented on the Field Robotics Lab Vehicle Software, which uses Lightweight Communication and Marshalling library to facilitate process communication and for easy transit to field testing. Simulation results are shown with discussions and lessons learned to guide future field experiments.},

This heterogeneous marsupial robotic system is composed by an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) that acts as a carrier and an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that acts as a passenger, and it is designed for military tasks and other tasks like environmental monitoring, wild life tracking, and search \& rescue missions. Through the combination, the cooperative marsupial robots benefit from their heterogeneity by using the superiority of each team member and overcoming their limitations. Moreover, the attitude control simulation model of the UAV is built, and the self-adaptive fuzzy parameter tuning rules for PID flight controller are given, so as to realize the online self-tuning of the controller parameters. Simulation results show that: compared with the conventional PID controller, this attitude control algorithm of fuzzy self-adaptive PID has a better dynamic response performance.},

ROAZ is an ocean capable catamaran for distinct oceanographic missions, and with the goal to fill the gap were other hydrographic surveys vehicles/systems are not compiled to operate, like very shallow water rivers and marine coastline surf zones.

One main innovation of the robot is the capability to measure heavy metals concentrations directly onboard using sensors ad hoc developed by the consortium. This enables the system to provide real-time measurements of heavy metals concentrations potentially changing the current water monitoring methodology in which the samples are collected by a dedicated boat and analyzed in laboratory. The robot is designed for long range missions and for lodging the onboard water analysis system. Some severe constraints imposed by the addressed scenarios are considered in the design: reduced length and limited weight for ease of transportability and deployment; low draft and protected propellers to enable the ASV to move safely in shallow waters with likely floating obstacles such as plastic bags.},

Each year SAUC-E challenges multidisciplinary University teams to design and build Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) capable of performing realistic missions. The AUVs must perform a series of tasks autonomously in the CMRE sea basin which represents a realistic and challenging environment characterized by limited visibility and salt water. The aim of SAUC-E is to act as a driver to bridge the gap between theory and practice often affecting universities' studies. The success of SAUC-E also contributed to the European Robotics Athlon project - euRathlon (http://www.eurathlon.eu/). In October 2014 a marine robotics competition in the framework of euRathlon was organized by CMRE at its basin and in nearby waters, featuring challenges different than SAUC-E's and inspired by the 2011 Fukushima disaster. This experience will lead to the organization in Piombino, Italy, in September 2015, of the first world competition in which autonomous flying, land, and sea robots will work together to achieve a disaster response goal.},

year={2015},
volume={40},
number={3},
pages={710-726},
abstract={In this paper, we describe the design, the development, and the sea trials of a novel small-sized autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) designed for monitoring the coastal water quality. The vehicle is characterized by the capability of measuring hydrocarbon and heavy metal concentrations directly onboard by means of custom-made miniaturized sensors. This capability, novel for an ASV, is combined with a winch-based sampling system specifically designed for small-sized vehicles. The sampling system can collect water samples up to 50 m in depth and measure the physical/water quality parameters of the water column. With these two features, the HydroNet ASV provides an autonomous, practical, real-time monitoring system, conceived to complement the current water monitoring practices in which samples are collected by a dedicated boat and analyzed in specialized laboratories at a later stage. The design process had the aim of realizing a vehicle capable of hosting the sampling system and the custom-made sensors that represent a unique payload in the world of small-sized ASVs. A twofold objective was pursued: realizing an ASV suited for monitoring missions in realistic scenarios (e.g., attention was paid to avoid water sample contamination), at the same time limiting the size for the ease of transportability and deployment. Severe constraints rose from these considerations and were addressed during the realization of the robot such as reduced length/weight (that limit the available space for the sensor payload) and low draft and protected propellers to allow the ASV to navigate in shallow waters with likely floating obstacles such as plastic bags. We report the design process aiming at a tradeoff between ease of transportability (small vehicle), available payload, and navigation performance in terms of achievable speed, endurance, and resistance to environmental disturbances (favored by larger ASV dimensions). We present sea trials of the realized vehicle validating the design choices. In particular, a long-range mission is discussed in which the robot executed a monitoring survey covering autonomously 12.5 km in front of Livorno, Italy, coast.},

Given a known aquatic environment and collection of aquatic surface vehicles with known kinematic and dynamic constraints, how can a fleet of vehicles be deployed to provide sensor coverage of the surface of the body of water? Rather than considering this problem in general, here we consider the problem given a specific fleet consisting of one very well equipped robot capable of global localization aided by a number of smaller, less well equipped devices that rely on the main robot for localization and thus must operate in close proximity to the main robot. A boustrophedon decomposition algorithm is developed that incorporates the motion, sensing and communication constraints imposed by the autonomous fleet. The approach is demonstrated in simulation using a real aquatic environment withe portions of the approach demonstrated using a fleet of real robots operating outdoors.},

The robots are designed for long-term missions and it is envisioned they can be deployed in swarms. They are self-powered and the electrical energy is scavenged by using solar cells and by using a novel application of the thermo-generator (Seebeck effect). The robots move passively transported by sea currents and winds taking inspiration by the locomotion of the Physalia physalis jellyfish. To monitor the water parameters also in depth a variable buoyancy device was developed to modify the volume of a bladder using as source of energy the sun radiation and the sea water temperature.

abstract={In recent years, sensorized autonomous vehicles (either AUVs or ASVs) have been increasingly used for in situ water measurements. However, collection of water samplings at depth by small-sized ASVs and their subsequent physical/chemical analysis onboard remains difficult due to size and weight constraints. This paper addresses this issue and describes the design and testing of an autonomous water monitoring and sampling system intended for operations onboard small-sized man-portable ASVs. The system is designed to collect water samples up to 50 m in depth and to measure physical water parameters along the water column. The system is composed of a probe lowered by a winch measuring physical water parameters and able to collect water samples at different selectable depths. Once the probe is returned onboard, a water distribution system transfers the collected water samples to sensors lodged in the ASV for the monitoring of chemical parameters, or into containers to transport the samples to laboratories on the mainland. The system combines small dimensions, self-cleaning capabilities, low weight, and limited power consumption allowing it to be easily installable and used on an autonomous small-sized ASVs. The sampling system was installed and tested in a robotic small-sized catamaran belonging to the HydroNet ASV class.},

Then a brief history of model based ship control systems with focus on the application of nonlinear theory to ship control is presented. The presentation describes the most recent results on nonlinear ship control in the period 1990-2000. This includes new results on nonlinear control system design for station-keeping (dynamic positioning and positioning mooring), autopilots for course-keeping and tracking control, (way-point, path and trajectory control), and underactuated control. A nonlinear separation principle for combination of a nonlinear full state feedback controller with a state observer in cascade is also presented. This is quite useful when desinging output feedback controllers since it guarantees globally stable combinations of different controllers and observers where the observer is needed for reconstruction of the unmeasured states. For linear systems a similar result is available through the separation principle and the LQG design methodlogy."

abstract={By equipping the research vessel Kilo Moana with a geodetic GPS receiver and a radar water level gauge, and using a kinematic GPS processing package, accurate 1 Hz estimates of the sea surface height were obtained. Geodetic positioning of ocean‐platforms using only the GPS system cannot account for changes in the draft of the platform. This is especially problematic for ships, where changes in the load, speed and/or ocean density can change the ship's draft by 10s of centimeters. By installing a radar gauge this noise source can be removed from the estimates of the sea surface height. We envision that this technology could routinely provide high resolution information on the geoid, or the variation of the sea surface height, including sea‐state, from an existing reference geoid.}

We show here that a modest ∼10 cm tsunami from the M8.8 27 Feb 2010 Maule, Chile earthquake was detected by kinematic Global Positions System (GPS) solutions from a ship underway in the open ocean ‐ the first time shipboard tsunami detection has been achieved. Our results illustrate how the commercial shipping fleet represents a vast infrastructure of potential open ocean GPS platforms on shipping lanes that provide extremely good spatial coverage around most tsunamigenic source regions. Given the affordability of geodetic GPS systems, and ever‐improving satellite communications, it would be possible to equip a significant portion of the shipping fleet with real‐time‐streamed GPS systems and create a cost‐effective tsunami monitoring network with denser and more distributed coverage. We project that such a system would have detected the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami in less than an hour.}

To this purpose, the employed vehicle is composed by two systems: i) a leading USV, equipped with an advanced mission control architecture, which performed a grid sampling over the study area; ii) a towed vehicle hosting an integrated system for acquisition of video and ultrasonic images, from the water column and the seafloor, coupled with a GPS receiver, which provided the geo-referencing of the survey. Data acquisition was carried out over different seafloor types, which included rock outcrops and sediments (mostly sand). The main key-points of employing such techniques to this peculiar field of coastal area monitoring are the possibility to perform automated missions and the capability to operate in very shallow water areas, usually not accessible to conventional boats."

This task is integral to many robotic applications, such as vacuum cleaning robots, painter robots, autonomous underwater vehicles creating image mosaics, demining robots, lawn mowers, automated harvesters, window cleaners and inspection of complex structures, just to name a few. A considerable body of research has addressed the CPP problem. However, no updated surveys on CPP reflecting recent advances in the field have been presented in the past ten years. In this paper, we present a review of the most successful CPP methods, focusing on the achievements made in the past decade. Furthermore, we discuss reported field applications of the described CPP methods. This work aims to become a starting point for researchers who are initiating their endeavors in CPP. Likewise, this work aims to present a comprehensive review of the recent breakthroughs in the field, providing links to the most interesting and successful works."

year={2012}, 
pages={1-7}, 
abstract={We outline a vision for persistent and/or long-range seafloor exploration and monitoring utilizing autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) and autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to conduct coordinated autonomous surveys. Three types of surveys are envisioned: a) Autonomous tending of deep-diving AUVs: deployed from a research vessel, the ASV would act as a force-multiplier, watching over the AUV to provide operators and scientists with real-time data and re-tasking capabilities, while freeing the ship to conduct other over-the-side operations; b) Ridge-segment-scale (100 km) autonomous hydrothermal exploration: combined with conventional gliders or long-endurance AUVs, an ASV could tend a fleet of underwater assets equipped with low-power chemical sensors for mapping hydrothermal plumes and locating seafloor hydrothermal venting. Operators would control the system via satellite, such that a support ship would be needed only for initial deployment and final recovery 1-2 months later; and c) Basin-scale (10,000 km) autonomous surveys: a purpose-built autonomous surface vessel (mother-ship) with abilities up to and including autonomous deployment, recovery, and re-charge of subsea robots could explore or monitor the ocean and seafloor on the oceanic basin scale at a fraction of the cost of a global-class research vessel. In this paper we outline our long term conceptual vision, discuss some preliminary enabling technology developments that we have already achieved and set out a roadmap for progress anticipated over the next 2-3 years. We present an overview of the system architecture for autonomous tending along with some preliminary field work.},

abstract="This chapter discusses the unmanned submersibles. The unmanned submersible is the direct result of the ocean community's increasing need to selectively sample and study in more detail the sea floor, as well as to visually inspect, build, and monitor undersea facilities. Cable-controlled underwater research vehicle I (CURV I) was primarily designed to retrieve torpedos from depths of up to 305 m. It was developed by the United States Naval Underwater Warfare Center, Pasadena, California in 1964 and fulfilled its role in February 1965 by retrieving a torpedo from a depth of 168 m. Another type of unmanned submersible is designed to crawl along the bottom and several varieties are available. The United States Navy's remote underwater manipulator (RUM) is a cable-tethered tracked model and was completed in 1958. There is another unmanned submersible that operates without a tether and offers a potential for under-ice studies and other forms of research as well. The Unmanned Arctic Research Submersible System (UARS) is a modification of the University of Washington's, applied physics laboratory's SPURV. The development of this vehicle began in 1959 and has continued to the present."

title={The enigmatic juridical regime of unmanned maritime systems}, 
year={2015}, 
pages={1-9}, 
abstract={The growing use of robotics in the maritime domain is about to pose questions on legal fallouts of autonomous systems to the international community. Unmanned maritime systems (UMS) such as autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are being increasingly employed for environmental and scientific studies. Applications of not weaponized robotic platforms for maritime security, littoral protection, antisubmarine warfare, and mine countermeasures are being investigated quite successfully both by civilian and military bodies. And more capabilities are expected to be developed for the archaeological surveys and Search And Rescue (SAR) operations. These growing spread and interest are due to the fact that, among the new maritime technologies, UMS are some of the most energy-efficient ones since they are usually equipped with small engines or they can even fly in the water without any propulsion but just using waves and currents as for example gliders do. Nevertheless the regulatory framework is lying far away from the technological fast advancement. Current experimental operations are forced to be always conducted under special authorisations and area clearances. But what is stopping the authorities to rule the use of these tools? The fact is that the issue of responsibility and liability for autonomous robots is difficult to be solved, even for not weaponized systems. Differently from aerial drones, whose civil use have been recently regulated in most countries, including the United States and the European Union, referring to pilot liability, unmanned vehicles are, as said, “un-manned”, without man in the loop or with men even far from remote control, being in a domain where radio connections are limited to submerging windows and control is transferred to software programming. This makes the application of personal responsibility challenging, while indeed undermining basics principles to which the law of the sea applies, f- r example, in the area of navigation safety: could UMS be defined as vessels according to international conventions or are they to be considered something different? What's the real degree of independence encompassed within the term autonomy? These thoughts lead to include into consideration also manned and remotely operated vessels, whose wire connection to human operators is clearer but which pose in any case questions on legal status. This paper is devoted to identify the legal blanks in the field and analyse the applicability to UMS of maritime legal regimes and present regulations at international level. First of all, particular attention will be paid in trying to ascertain the status of such devices in order to reach a categorization of them under a maritime law perspective. Secondly, the article will analyse the juridical implications deriving from the various maritime zones as defined by the law of the sea towards the transit, the use and the operation of UMS. Going into details, the circulation of the aforesaid instruments is going to be examined in the light of the “innocent passage” institution. Lastly, the research will be focused on the liability arising from the employment of these systems in case of collision with other vessels, cultural and natural assets, private goods, or other harbour infrastructures and, more in general, where a violation of the navigational rules against casualties could be recognized. In particular, the study will mainly involve the IMO Conventions consecrated to safety or security measures and environmental issues.},

abstract="The unraveling of the human-induced climate-change crisis has put to the forth the ability of human-beings to impact the planet as a whole, but the discourse of politics has also emphasized the ability of the human race to adapt and counterweigh the environmental change, in turn increasing the public expectation that one should be able to control nature and its affects. Such cozy and reassured society consequently puts an increasing amount of pressure on hazards assessors, emergency and disaster managers ``to get it right'', and not only to save the majority, but to save all. To reach such level of competency, emergency relief teams and disaster managers have to work always faster with an increasing need of high quality, high-resolution geospatial data. This need is being partly resolved with the usage of UAV (Unmanned Autonomous Vehicles), both on the ground and airborne.",

Natural environments widely vary in appearance over time, which reduces the effectiveness of many appearance-based data association techniques.

We have deployed an autonomous surface vessel 30 times over a duration of 8 months.

abstract={ Technology has become the solution to many long-standing problems, and while current technologies may be effective, it is far from fully addressing the hug, complex, difficult and challenging tasks associated with disaster missions and risky intervention. The challenge is in finding creative, reliable and applicable technical solutions in such highly constrained and uncertain environment. In addition, it is necessary to overcome constrains on resources by developing innovative, cost effective and practical technology. Robotics can play important intelligent and technological roles that support first response equipment in harsh and dangerous environments while replacing rescue personnel from entering unreachable or unsafe places. Robotics solutions that are well adapted to local conditions of unstructured and unknown environment can greatly improve safety and security of personnel as well as work efficiency, productivity and flexibility. Solving and fulfilling the needs of such tasks presents challenges in robotic mechanical structure and mobility, sensors and sensor fusion, autonomous and semi autonomous control, planning and navigation, and machine intelligence. This paper categorizes the source of disasters and associated missions, and highlights the needs for suitable and reliable technology and technical and functional requirements of robotic systems to fulfill task objectives. In addition, it shows that robotic technologies can be used for disasters prevention or early warning, intervention and recovery efforts during disasters with all possible kinds of relevant missions while ensuring quality of service and safety of human beings. Some of these missions may include: demining, search and rescue, surveillance, reconnaissance and risk assessment, evacuation assistance, intrusion/victim detection and assessment, etc. }

This capability is particularly useful for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) operating near large structures such as bridges, waterside buildings, towers and cranes, where global positioning system signals are restricted or unavailable due to the line-of-sight restrictions. This study proposes a high-precision navigation technique using dead-reckoning sensors and lidars, which enables building a parameterized map of artificial bridge structures and estimating the vehicle's position relative to the parameterized map simultaneously. Also, three-dimensional reconstruction of the surrounding structures is carried out by fusing camera and lidar measurements for realistic 3D visual mapping which may facilitate automated surveys and inspection of structural safety.

abstract="Global Positioning System (GPS) is an important component for marine vehicle navigation. However, GPS may not be reliable or even available in some situations, since GPS signals can be easily blocked or reflected by large structures and they are susceptible to jamming and spoofing attacks. In fact, radar is one of the standard navigation instruments, and radar measurements can be utilized for vehicle localization by coastline matching into a prior map. In this paper, a radar-based localization via automatic map matching is proposed for unmanned surface vehicle (USV) navigation in a littoral area. A pulse radar is employed to collect surrounding coastline information, and relative position of the vehicle with respect to the pre-built map is estimated by coastline matching. Field experiments using a USV with an onboard radar in a real sea environment were performed to verify and demonstrate the performance of the proposed navigation approach."

The human interfaces used by 67 Micro and Small X, Intermediate, Harbor, Fleet, and E,F,G-Class platforms were examined and it was determined that: i) the research literature does not well characterize the human roles present in unmanned surface systems, ii) domain complexity may necessitate increased automation of the robot platform for the human team, and iii) that unmanned surface vehicles likely lay on the human-machine interaction spectrum between unmanned ground vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles. This work is expected to serve as a reference for future design and refinement of human interfaces for USSs and as a foundation for better understanding HMI in USSs.},

abstract={This article presents a novel autonomous surface vessel (ASV) that was designed and manufactured specifically for the monitoring of water resources, resources that are not only constantly drained but also face the growing threat of mass proliferation (bloom) of noxious cyanobacteria. On one hand, the distribution of these blooms in a given water body requires a surveillance of biological data at high spatial resolution on both vertical and horizontal axes, whereas on the other hand, the understanding of the temporal evolution of the cyanobacteria necessitates repeated sampling at the same location. Therefore, our ASV was designed to combine the ability to take measurements within a range of depths, with its custom-made winch, and accurate localization provided by the global positioning system (GPS), without the need for static installations. This article first describes the ASV conception, and then the results of extended field tests on the waypoint navigation mode are discussed. Finally, the first results of a sampling campaign for monitoring algal blooms in Lake Zurich are presented. This work constitutes advances in the deployment of mobile measurement platforms for environmental monitoring in lacustrine environments. Furthermore, it investigates the application of a single ASV to capture both spatial and temporal dynamics of harmful cyanobacterial blooms in lakes. Combining surface mobility with depth measurements within a single robot allows fast deployments in remote location, which is cost efficient for lake sampling. This reduces the need for fixed installations, which can be impossible in recreational areas. The high-resolution sampling of lakes will contribute to understand and predict the occurrence of harmful cyanobacterial blooms for a better management of water resources.},

While government officials and others might solicit economic estimates of any kind in order to justify idiosyncratic public health or scientific agendas, attention should be directed at developing estimates of true economic losses, i.e., surplus changes. Based upon our experience with the field, although the number of studies of economic losses or impacts is limited, they outnumber studies of the economic costs of societal responses to HAB events. In other words, societal responses to HABs have been debated, formulated, and implemented with an inadequate understanding of the net benefits of such responses. Further efforts on the economics of HABs should focus on identifying the array of societal responses and characterizing the cost minimizing combination of management actions.",

year={2011}, 
pages={1-8}, 
abstract={This paper describes the development of the Unmanned Port Security Vessel (UPSV), a small autonomous surface vehicle designed to support maritime domain awareness in port and harbor environments. The UPSV is capable of rapidly producing fine resolution, shallow-water bathymetry maps using a multibeam sonar, detecting chemical threats using an on board mass spectrometer and monitoring oceanographic parameters using off-the-shelf instruments. In this paper we discuss the significance and scientific advantages of sensor fusion on a small autonomous robotic platform, as well as detailing the control methods chosen for such a vehicle. Command and control of the robotic platform is implemented using the lightweight communications and marshalling (LCM) library, a general purpose software infrastructure for sensor integration and feedback control. Based on this foundation we have built a flexible software architecture that includes mission planning, real-time navigation and control, payload management and telemetry to support a variety of maritime domain awareness missions. Using the developed software and control methods, the UPSV is capable of autonomously generating high fidelity bathymetric maps while simultaneously conducting chemical surveys with a mass spectrometer. We demonstrate the utility of the software architecture and hardware integration through results from both simulation and experiments. We present the results of a set of field trials to evaluate the performance of the UPSV in operational settings. These experiments include system identification for estimation and control, feedback control performance evaluation, demonstration of autonomous high-resolution bathymetric mapping and demonstration of in-situ chemical sensing. The performance of the UPSV's control system is characterized with the presented navigation data, and the results of the bathymetric surveys and in-situ chemical sensing are detailed. The implementation of this functionality on a small,- deployable platform is discussed in the context of similar projects on unmanned surface vehicles.},

 abstract={ Chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive (CBRNE) incident response varies dramatically based upon the hazardous material, the incident size and the response duration. Robots can facilitate response planning, maintaining situational awareness, removing responders from dangerous situations and allowing for immediate site feedback prior to human responder entry. This paper presents eight robotic tasks informed by a cognitive task analysis and an information flow analysis. These analyses were conducted in order to inform the design of a system of multiple robots and the associated human–robotic interfaces required to support the CBRNE response command hierarchy. The cognitive task analysis was conducted over 3 years, and incorporated direct CBRNE response personnel feedback and CBRNE incident exercise observations. This paper presents the identified tasks and how robots can augment the existing human-based CBRNE incident response by improving the provided information and the speed at which information can be obtained, and reduce responders' physical workload. It is clear from our analyses that poorly designed robots and task capabilities will be highly disruptive to the human-centric CBRNE response activities. }

Water depth measurement a.k.a bathymetry is important for critical areas such as river and water reservoir (dam) to estimate the volume and surface area for environment conservation and safety purpose. Conventionally, in inland water monitoring, the data obtained from the measurements are recorded in the log book and have to go through some screening process before plotting contour. This procedure is not only slow but also requires a lot of logistic equipment and labor forces. Therefore, an Autonomous Surface Vessel equipped with an echo sounder and data telemetry is proposed. It can be either remotely controlled or run automatically by autopilot navigation software. It is also equipped with GPS and compass for the navigation sensor feedback. The ASV was tested at several lakes for the performance of data collection and navigation.},

volume="3",

pages="25",
abstract="Ship height positioning by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) was investigated for measuring and forecasting great tsunamis. We first examined GNSS height-positioning data of a navigating vessel. If we use the kinematic precise point positioning (PPP) method, tsunamis greater than 10−1m will be detected by ship height positioning. Based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, we found that tens of cargo ships and tankers are usually identified to navigate over the Nankai Trough, southwest Japan. We assumed that a future Nankai Trough great earthquake tsunami will be observed by the kinematic PPP height positioning of an AIS-derived ship distribution, and examined the tsunami forecast capability of the offshore tsunami measurements based on the PPP-based ship height. A method to estimate the initial tsunami height distribution using offshore tsunami observations was used for forecasting. Tsunami forecast tests were carried out using simulated tsunami data by the PPP-based ship height of 92 cargo ships/tankers, and by currently operating deep-sea pressure and Global Positioning System (GPS) buoy observations at 71 stations over the Nankai Trough. The forecast capability using the PPP-based height of the 92 ships was shown to be comparable to or better than that using the operating offshore observatories at the 71 stations. We suppose that, immediately after the occurrence of a great earthquake, stations receiving successive ship information (AIS data) along certain areas of the coast would fail to acquire ship data due to strong ground shaking, especially near the epicenter. Such a situation would significantly deteriorate the tsunami-forecast capability using ship data. On the other hand, operational real-time analysis of seismic/geodetic data would be carried out for estimating a tsunamigenic fault model. Incorporating the seismic/geodetic fault model estimation into the tsunami forecast above possibly compensates for the deteriorated forecast capability.",

Remote sensing is currently used operationally for some monitoring programs, though there are also difficulties associated with the rapid acquisition of data and provision of a robust product to emergency services as an end-user.

abstract={This study examines the integration of ocean glider Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) and Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) in support of wide-area oceanographic and acoustic sampling. These collaborative systems could enable the U.S. Navy to conduct multi-month unmanned maritime surveillance. Optimal sensor position in the water column and persistence are critical requirements to reduce surface expressions of such a network. An experiment was conducted in Monterey Bay to evaluate underwater gliders as mobile passive acoustic sensing platforms. Acoustic propagation modeling was used to plan experiment geometry, predict transmission loss (TL), and estimate acoustic communications performance with a USV. A medium frequency acoustic source was deployed at a range of 5.5 km from a receiver on board a glider conducting a 1000 m dive to demonstrate that a glider can adapt to the local environment to exploit more reliable propagation paths. Results demonstrate that gliders are effective mobile platforms to support persistent acoustic sensing. The glider received transmitted signals at levels in close agreement with TL predictions. Signals were received while the glider was in motion, and reception improved during a quiet deep loiter. Given the depths, ranges, and environmental conditions studied, research and modeling suggest sufficient acoustic communication performance to promote connectivity of the proposed network},

 abstract={Underwater Wireless Sensor Networks (UWSNs) may be easily partitioned due to resource constraints and sparse deployment, and such UWSNs need to be treated as Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networks (DTN). The principal objective of DTN routing is to maximize the possibility of eventual data delivery, which can be achieved only at the cost of high energy consumption and/or increased message latency. The energy efficiency and network lifetime are more important than data collection latency for certain underwater applications. We consider energy-efficient data collection using mobile elements, which is suitable for longterm sensing applications that are not time-critical. Using different analytical models, we investigate energy efficiency, network lifetime, packet delivery ratio, and message latency in a mobility-assisted data collection framework for UWSNs. The analytical models are validated with the experimental setup developed using the NS-2 based Aqua-Sim simulator. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework shows superior performance in terms of energy efficiency, network lifetime, and packet delivery ratio at the cost of increased message latency. The analytical models for delay performance are compared to see that the polling model is more effective in modelling the mobility-assisted data collection framework for UWSNs and more flexible in implementing different service policies.},

Firstly, the readings of the environmental sensors at a moment are compensated to the prospecting readings of the sensors considering a network delay measured and the kinematic model of a robot. The compensated readings of the sensors are used for building the polar histogram of the VFH algorithm. Secondly, a sensory fusion using the Kalman filter is proposed for the localization of the robot to compensate both the delay of readings of an odometry sensor and the delay of readings of environmental sensors.

number="1",
pages="1--18",
abstract="Inter-vehicle docking is the problem of coordinating multiple robots to actively form and maintain physical contact. It is an important capability for autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) and is an essential part of a wide class of missions. This article considers one such mission: the emergency response and environmental protection problem of containing a floating pollutant. We propose a solution in which multiple robots autonomously navigate so as to surround the surface matter. Before doing so, the robots dock with one another to secure specialized attachments designed to ensnare the contaminant. We describe the prototypical physical robot system developed to perform this task, and we detail the system architecture, sensing and computational hardware, control system, and visual processing pipeline. While employing multiple ASVs maximizes spatial reconfigurability, it depends on the inter-robot docking capabilities being particularly reliable. But achieving robust docking is a significant technical challenge because the water continually induces external disturbances on the control system. These disturbances are non-stationary and almost impossible to predict for unknown environments. Our system relies primarily on visual servoing within a control framework in which a variety of sensors are fused. Accurate disturbance measurements are obtained through traditional sensor modeling and filtering techniques. As the environment is a priori unknown, varies from trial to trial, and has proven difficult to model, we apply a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, SARSA($\lambda$), along with specialized initial conditions which ensure stable operation, and an exploration guidance approach that increases the speed of convergence. We adopt a two-loop control scheme for visual servoing to successfully make use of feature descriptors with various (and variable) computational times. We demonstrate this approach to the docking problem with autonomous ground vehicles and ASVs. The results from several situations are compared, showing that disturbance rejection coupled with SARSA($\lambda$) is an effective approach.",

abstract={Sidescan sonar coupled with a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) provides a near photographic image of features underwater for use in mapping applications. Sidescan sonar acoustic pings are drawn as raw images, spatially referenced using GNSS coordinates and then mosaiced in specialized software to produce coverage areas. The resulting two dimensional images can then be analyzed in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for manmade or natural underwater features. This technology has a special application for mapping eelgrass extent in Southern California, which has become a focus of research for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) and several National Marine Estuary programs. Eelgrass is a submerged aquatic flowering plant that provides critical structural environments for resident bay and estuarine species, including abundant fish and invertebrates and is often a primary diet for several grazing snails. This project demonstrates the viability of creating a low-cost Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) with an attached sidescan sonar sensor for scientist and researchers to use in mapping eelgrass. The remote sensing imagery collected by the USV is classified in ArcGIS to calculate the full spatial extent of the visible eelgrass beds. The results of this project show acoustic imagery collected by a USV can be used to create classified bottom composition maps through manual classification. Unsupervised classification did not produce the desired results and is still a work in progress. By demonstrating these mapping tools, researchers can conduct studies at a much lower cost and on their own time instead of relying on expensive, contracted surveys.},

abstract={Experimental testing of an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) has been performed to evaluate the performance of two low-level controllers when displacement and drag properties are time varying and uncertain. The USV is a 4.3-m-long, 150-kg wave adaptive modular vessel (WAM-V) with an inflatable twin-hull configuration and waterjet propulsion. Open-loop maneuvering tests were conducted to characterize the dynamics of the vehicle. The hydrodynamic coefficients of the vehicle were determined through system identification of the maneuvering data and were used for simulations during control system development. The resulting controllers were experimentally field tested on-water. Variable mass and drag tests show that the vehicle is best controlled by a model reference adaptive backstepping speed and heading controller. The backstepping controller developed by Liao et al. (2010) is modified to account for an overprediction of necessary control action and motor saturation. It is shown that when an adaptive algorithm is implemented for the surge control subsystem of the modified backstepping controller, the effects of variable mass and drag are mitigated.},

abstract={Autonomous surface vehicles (ASVs) are likely to revolutionize the maritime industry in the near future. To obtain situation awareness and avoid collisions, information from various types of sensors is needed. Visual cameras mounted on an ASV provide a detailed description of its surroundings. In this thesis, an algorithm for object detection in images based on unsupervised learning is implemented and tested. Different from supervised learning, unsupervised learning algorithms have no ground truth to use as guidance for learning what type of objects it should detect. This saves a large amount of human labor, and enables detection of objects the algorithm has not seen before. The object detection algorithm is based on a neural network, specifically an autoencoder, that is trained to represent visual ocean features well, while highlighting what it consider anomalous. Hence, the algorithm relies on the assumption that objects are represented as anomalies in the image data. The evaluation shows that the algorithm at its best is able to detect all objects. However, this comes at the expense of a high number of false positives. The maritime environment contains a lot of natural features, such as waves, that stand out visually. These are often considered anomalous by the algorithm, and therefore detected as objects.},

Most of the current researches consider a fixed-wing type UAV for surveillance of multiple moving targets (MMT), whose functionality is limited to just UAV movements. Experiments in simulation are conducted and verified that, prioritizing camera movements increased the number of times each USV is visited (on an average by 5.68 times more), decreased the percentage of the duration that the UAV is not observing any USV (on an average by 19.8%) and increased the efficiency by decreasing the distance traveled by the UAV (on an average by 747 pixels) for the six test cases. Autonomous repositioning of the UAV at regular intervals to observe USVs during a disaster scenario will provide the operator with better situational awareness. Using a rotorcraft over a fixed-wing type UAV provides the operator with a flexibility of observing the target for the required duration by hovering and freedom of unrestricted movements, which help improve the efficiency of target observation.},

abstract={Obstacle detection plays an important role in unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). The USVs operate in a highly diverse environments in which an obstacle may be a floating piece of wood, a scuba diver, a pier, or a part of a shoreline, which presents a significant challenge to continuous detection from images taken on board. This paper addresses the problem of online detection by constrained, unsupervised segmentation. To this end, a new graphical model is proposed that affords a fast and continuous obstacle image-map estimation from a single video stream captured on board a USV. The model accounts for the semantic structure of marine environment as observed from USV by imposing weak structural constraints. A Markov random field framework is adopted and a highly efficient algorithm for simultaneous optimization of model parameters and segmentation mask estimation is derived. Our approach does not require computationally intensive extraction of texture features and comfortably runs in real time. The algorithm is tested on a new, challenging, dataset for segmentation, and obstacle detection in marine environments, which is the largest annotated dataset of its kind. Results on this dataset show that our model outperforms the related approaches, while requiring a fraction of computational effort.},

This system utilises an autonomously acting rescue vessel to salvage a person overboard to increase significantly the chance of survival. It was developed to be used on special ships or offshore platforms, where workers have to act in bad weather conditions and often going overboard of a person will be discovered too late. A substantial challenge is the automation of the autonomously acting rescue vehicle as well as the integration into the superior Search-and-Rescue-Process. The developed cascaded control concepts were designed to ensure the fastest possible approach to the casualty without endangering the person. Therefore, two degrees of freedom control concepts are used to separate the reference values from the disturbances. The inner speed control structure is divided into two parts and consists of the control structure itself with an in-line allocation to the device configuration. The paper mainly addresses the automation of the rescue vessel, the synthesis of the control system of the autonomously acting vehicle as well as the integration into the superior Search-and-Rescue-Process. Additionally, some test result of this complex system are shown at the end of the paper."

volume={39}, 
number={1}, 
pages={110-119}, 
abstract={This paper presents an autonomous motion planning algorithm for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to navigate safely in dynamic, cluttered environments. The algorithm not only addresses hazard avoidance (HA) for stationary and moving hazards, but also applies the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (known as COLREGS, for COLlision REGulationS). The COLREGS rules specify, for example, which vessel is responsible for giving way to the other and to which side of the “stand-on” vessel to maneuver. Three primary COLREGS rules are considered in this paper: crossing, overtaking, and head-on situations. For autonomous USVs to be safely deployed in environments with other traffic boats, it is imperative that the USV's navigation algorithm obeys COLREGS. Furthermore, when other boats disregard their responsibility under COLREGS, the USV must fall back to its HA algorithms to prevent a collision. The proposed approach is based on velocity obstacles (VO) method, which generates a cone-shaped obstacle in the velocity space. Because VOs also specify on which side of the obstacle the vehicle will pass during the avoidance maneuver, COLREGS are encoded in the velocity space in a natural way. Results from several experiments involving up to four vessels are presented, in what we believe is the first on-water demonstration of autonomous COLREGS maneuvers without explicit intervehicle communication. We also show an application of this motion planner to a target trailing task, where a strategic planner commands USV waypoints based on high-level objectives, and the local motion planner ensures hazard avoidance and compliance with COLREGS during a traverse.},

Selected innovative countermeasure concepts and guidance derived from practice outside the United States are introduced. Management strategies and guidance for developing a Plan of Action for scour critical bridges are outlined, and guidance is provided for scour monitoring using portable and fixed instrumentation.

The results of recently completed National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) projects are incorporated in the design guidance, including: countermeasures to protect bridge piers and abutments from scour; riprap design criteria, specifications, and quality control; and environmentally sensitive channel and bank protection measures. This additional material required expanding HEC-23 to two volumes. Volume 1 now contains a complete chapter on riprap design,
specifications, and quality control as well as an expanded chapter on biotechnical ountermeasures. The guidance on scour monitoring instrumentation has been updated and now includes additional installation case studies.

abstract={Multi-robot systems control over many advantages over a single-robot managing system, including redundancy, coverage and flexibility. One of the important technical considerations in fielding multirobot systems for real-world applications is the coordinating the different units. The cluster based controlling technique using simplified specification and monitoring of the movement of mobile multirobot systems. Our previous work has established this approach and has experimentally verified its use for land-based systems consisting of 2-4 robots and with varying implementations ranging from automated movement control to human-in-the-loop piloting. In this paper, we plan the design and fabrication of a new low-cost autonomous surface vessel (ASV). The technical system includes a multi-robot system capable of autonomous navigation using the cluster control technique. It also adds a centralized controller, currently connected via a shore-based computer that wirelessly receives ASV data and relays using commands. Using the different cluster space control approach, these drive commands allow a robot to remotely drive a two-ASV cluster or to specify that the two ASVs maintain formation with a third robot. The resulting multi-ASV clusters can be translated, and resized depending on the needs of a particular application. Experimental results demonstrating these abililities of robots to provide, and plans for future work are discussed.}

abstract={In order to minimize the costs, risks, and disruptions associated with structural inspections, robotic systems have increasingly been studied as an enhancement to current inspection practices. Combined with the increasing variety of commercially available robots, the last two decades have seen dramatic growth in the application of such systems. The use of these systems spans the breadth of civil infrastructure works, and the variety of implemented robotic systems is growing rapidly. However, the highly interdisciplinary nature of research in this field means that results are disseminated across a broad variety of publications. This review paper aggregates these studies in an effort to distill the state of the art in inspection robotics, as well as to assess outstanding challenges in the field and possibilities for the future. Overall, analysis of these studies illustrates that the design of inspection robots is often a case-specific compromise between competing needs for sophisticated inspection sensing and for flexible locomotion in challenging field environments. This review also points toward the growing use of robots as a platform to deploy advanced nondestructive evaluation (NDE) technologies, as well as the expanded use of commercially available robotic systems. Two key outstanding challenges for future researchers are suggested as well. The first is the need for more sophisticated, and inspection-driven, robot autonomy. The other is the need to process and manipulate the massive data sets that modern robots generate.},

  title={Mapping of complex marine environments using an unmanned surface craft},
  author={Leedekerken, Jacques Chadwick},
  year={2011},
  school={Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science},
  abstract={Recent technology has combined accurate GPS localization with mapping to build 3D maps in a diverse range of terrestrial environments, but the mapping of marine environments lags behind. This is particularly true in shallow water and coastal areas with man-made structures such as bridges, piers, and marinas, which can pose formidable challenges to autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) operations. In this thesis, we propose a new approach for mapping shallow water marine environments, combining data from both above and below the water in a robust probabilistic state estimation framework. The ability to rapidly acquire detailed maps of these environments would have many applications, including surveillance, environmental monitoring, forensic search, and disaster recovery. Whereas most recent AUV mapping research has been limited to open waters, far from man-made surface structures, in our work we focus on complex shallow water environments, such as rivers and harbors, where man-made structures block GPS signals and pose hazards to navigation. Our goal is to enable an autonomous surface craft to combine data from the heterogeneous environments above and below the water surface - as if the water were drained, and we had a complete integrated model of the marine environment, with full visibility. To tackle this problem, we propose a new framework for 3D SLAM in marine environments that combines data obtained concurrently from above and below the water in a robust probabilistic state estimation framework. Our work makes systems, algorithmic, and experimental contributions in perceptual robotics for the marine environment. We have created a novel Autonomous Surface Vehicle (ASV), equipped with substantial onboard computation and an extensive sensor suite that includes three SICK lidars, a Blueview MB2250 imaging sonar, a Doppler Velocity Log, and an integrated global positioning system/inertial measurement unit (GPS/IMU) device. The data from these sensors is processed in a hybrid metric/topological SLAM state estimation framework. A key challenge to mapping is extracting effective constraints from 3D lidar data despite GPS loss and reacquisition. This was achieved by developing a GPS trust engine that uses a semi-supervised learning classifier to ascertain the validity of GPS information for different segments of the vehicle trajectory. This eliminates the troublesome effects of multipath on the vehicle trajectory estimate, and provides cues for submap decomposition. Localization from lidar point clouds is performed using octrees combined with Iterative Closest Point (ICP) matching, which provides constraints between submaps both within and across different mapping sessions. Submap positions are optimized via least squares optimization of the graph of constraints, to achieve global alignment. The global vehicle trajectory is used for subsea sonar bathymetric map generation and for mesh reconstruction from lidar data for 3D visualization of above-water structures. We present experimental results in the vicinity of several structures spanning or along the Charles River between Boston and Cambridge, MA. The Harvard and Longfellow Bridges, three sailing pavilions and a yacht club provide structures of interest, having both extensive superstructure and subsurface foundations. To quantitatively assess the mapping error, we compare against a georeferenced model of the Harvard Bridge using blueprints from the Library of Congress. Our results demonstrate the potential of this new approach to achieve robust and efficient model capture for complex shallow-water marine environments. Future work aims to incorporate autonomy for path planning of a region of interest while performing collision avoidance to enable fully autonomous surveys that achieve full sensor coverage of a complete marine environment.},

abstract={Ground or aerial robots equipped with advanced sensing technologies, such as three-dimensional laser scanners and advanced mapping algorithms, are deemed useful as a supporting technology for first responders. A great deal of excellent research in the field exists, but practical applications at real disaster sites are scarce. Many projects concentrate on equipping robots with advanced capabilities, such as autonomous exploration or object manipulation. In spite of this, realistic application areas for such robots are limited to teleoperated reconnaissance or search. In this paper, we investigate how well state-of-the-art and off-the-shelf components and algorithms are suited for reconnaissance in current disaster-relief scenarios. The basic idea is to make use of some of the most common sensors and deploy some widely used algorithms in a disaster situation, and to evaluate how well the components work for these scenarios. We acquired the sensor data from two field experiments, one from a disaster-relief operation in a motorway tunnel, and one from a mapping experiment in a partly closed down motorway tunnel. Based on these data, which we make publicly available, we evaluate state-of-the-art and off-the-shelf mapping approaches. In our analysis, we integrate opinions and replies from first responders as well as from some algorithm developers on the usefulness of the data and the limitations of the deployed approaches, respectively. We discuss the lessons we learned during the two missions. These lessons are interesting for the community working in similar areas of urban search and rescue, particularly reconnaissance and search.},

abstract={ Objective: The number of robots an operator can supervise increases with the robots’ level of autonomy. The reported study investigates multirobot foraging to identify aspects of the task most suitable for automation. Background: Many envisioned applications of robotics involve multirobot teams. One of the simplest of these applications is foraging, in which robots are operated independently to explore and discover targets. Depending on levels of autonomy and task, operators have been found able to manage 3 to 12 robots. Method: The foraging task can be functionally subdivided into visiting new regions and identifying targets. In the reported experiment, full-task foraging performance was compared with exploration and perceptual search performance for 4-, 8-, and 12-robot teams in a between-groups repeated measures design. Results: Operators in the full-task condition could not successfully manage 12 robots, finding only half as many victims as perceptual search operators. Exploration performance was roughly the same in the full-task and exploration conditions, suggesting that performance of this subtask was limiting the number of robots that could be controlled. Conclusion: Performance and workload measures indicate that exploration (navigation) tasks are the limiting factor in multirobot foraging. This finding suggests that robot navigation is the best candidate for automation. Application: Search tasks, such as foraging or perimeter control, account for many of the near-term applications envisioned for multirobot teams. The results support the choice of task-centered architectures in which the control and coordination of robotic platforms is automated, leaving search and identification of targets to human operators. }

abstract={ The authors are developing a theory for human control of robot teams based on considering how control difficulty grows with team size. Current work focuses on domains, such as foraging, in which robots perform largely independent tasks. Such tasks are particularly amenable to analysis because effects on performance and cognitive resources are predicted to be additive, and tasks can safely be allocated across operators because of their independence. The present study addresses the interaction between automation and organization of human teams in controlling large robot teams performing an urban search-and-rescue (USAR) task. Two possible ways to organize operators were identified: as individual assignments of robots to operators, assigned robots, or as a shared pool in which operators service robots from the population as needed. The experiment compares two-person teams of operators controlling teams of 12 robots each in the assigned-robots condition or sharing control of 24 robots in the shared-pool condition using either waypoint control in the manual condition or autonomous path planning in the autonomy condition. Automating path planning improved system performance, but process measures suggest it may weaken situation awareness. }

abstract={ In this chapter, I review research involving remote human supervision of multiple unmanned vehicles (UVs) using command complexity as an organizing construct. Multi-UV tasks range from foraging, requiring little coordination among UVs, to formation following, in which UVs must function as a cohesive unit. Command complexity, the degree to which operator effort increases with the number of supervised UVs, is used to categorize human interaction with multiple UVs. For systems in which each UV requires the same form of attention (O(n)), effort increases linearly with the number of UVs. For systems in which the control of one UV is dependent upon another (O(>n)), additional UVs impose greater than linear increases due to the expense of coordination. For other systems, an operator interacts with an autonomously coordinating group, and effort is unaffected by group size (O(1)). Studies of human/multi-UV interaction can be roughly grouped into O(n) supervision, involving one-to-one control of individual UVs, or O(1) commanding, in which higher-level commands are directed to a group. Research in O(n) command has centered on round-robin control, neglect tolerance, and attention switching. Approaches to O(1) command are divided into systems using autonomous path planning only, plan libraries, human-steered planners, and swarms. Each type of system has its advantages. Less complete work in scalable displays for multiple UVs is reviewed. Mixing levels of command is probably necessary to supervise multiple UVs performing realistic tasks. Research in O(n) control is mature and can provide quantitative and qualitative guidance for design. Interaction with planners and swarms is less mature but more critical to developing effective multi-UV systems capable of performing complex tasks. }

abstract={ AbstractAn unmanned surface vehicle (USV) was designed and constructed to operate continuously for covering both flood and ebb and preferably a complete tidal cycle (e.g., ~24 h) to measure the vertical profiles of horizontal flow velocity. It was applied in a tidal channel at Port Fourchon, Louisiana. A bottom-mounted ADCP was deployed for 515 days. The first EOF mode of the velocity profiles showed a barotropic type of flow that explained more than 98.2\% of the variability. The second mode showed a typical estuarine flow with two layers, which explained 0.47\% of the variability. Using a linear regression of the total transport from the USV with the vertically averaged velocity from the bottom-mounted ADCP, with an R-squared value of 98\%, the total along-channel transport throughout the deployment was calculated. A low-pass filtering of the transport allowed for examining the impact of 76 events with cold, warm, or combined cold–warm fronts passing the area. The top seven most severe events were discussed, as their associated transports obviously stood out in the time series, indicating the importance of weather. It is shown that large-scale weather systems with frontal lines of ~1500–3000-km horizontal length scale control the subtidal transport in the area. Cold (warm) fronts tend to generate outward (inward) transports, followed by a rebound. The maximum coherence between the atmospheric forcing and the ocean response reached ~71\%–84\%, which occurred at about a frequency f of ~0.29 cycle per day or T of ~3.4 days in the period, consistent with the atmospheric frontal return periods (~3–7 days). }

This paper proposes an approach and develops a system for auto bridge crack detection based on our well-developed bridge-climbing robot, which collects crack images with a high-resolution camera. In order to extract cracks and features automatically, a crack detection algorithm is proposed in this paper. There exits challenging issue on discriminating the real bridge crack from fake bridge crack, which does not harm the safety of the bridge. An approach of line structured light is proposed to address the issue.

abstract={Unmanned surface vehicle (USV) as a new platform has obvious advantages in the marine environmental monitoring. For the requirement of oil spill detection at the sea area of oil spills occur frequently, such as coastal ports, an USV-based laser fluorosensor was developed in our laboratory. In this paper, the overall scheme of USV-based laser fluorosensor system has been proposed, and it consists of shore-based terminal and laser fluorosensor. The laser fluorosensor system has been designed in detail. The axis of the transmitter and receiver in the system are coincident. A micro-pulse nitrogen laser and an ICCD are used as the excitation source and detector respectively. The laser and ICCD are both working at external trigger mode, and a delay generator outputs two TTL signals with fixed delay time to accomplish the time sequence control of the laser and ICCD camera, hence the range-gated detection of the system. The system performance has been tested both in the laboratory and field. The obtained results suggest that the optimal gate pulse delay and gate width of range-gated detection are 112~113ns and 10ns respectively under the condition of 5 meters detection range. The stability of the system has also been tested by repeated measurements, and the relative standard deviation is determined to be 3.47 %. The feasibility of applying the system to the field detection has also been verified in this work.},

abstract={Unmanned vehicles (UVs) are playing an increasingly significant role in modern daily life. In the past decades, numerous commercial, scientific, and military communities across the world are developing fully autonomous UVs for a variety of applications, such as environmental monitoring and surveillance, post-disaster search and rescue, border patrol, natural resources exploration, and experimental platforms for new technologies verification. The excessive opportunities and threats that come along with these diverse applications have created a niche demand for UVs to extend their capabilities to perform more sophisticated and hazardous missions with greater autonomy, lower costs of development and operation, improved personnel safety and security, extended operational range (reliability) and precision, as well as increased flexibility in sophisticated environments including so-called dirty, dull, harsh, and dangerous missions.
In order to successfully and effectively execute missions and meet their corresponding performance criteria and overcome these ever-increasing challenges, greater autonomy together with more advanced reliable and safe motion control systems are required to offer the critical technologies for ensuring intelligent, safe, reliable, and efficient control of UVs in the presence of disturbances, actuator saturation, and even actuator faults, especially for practical applications. 
This thesis concentrates on the development of different reliable and safe motion control algorithms/strategies applicable to UVs, in particular, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). A number of contributions pertaining to the fault detection and diagnosis (FDD), fault-tolerant control (FTC), disturbance estimation and compensation, and actuator saturation avoidance have been made in this thesis. In addition to the control problems, this thesis also presents several guidance-related contributions, including adaptive observer-based line-of-sight (LOS) guidance law, time-varying lookahead distance scheme, piecewise path switching criterion for guiding a single UV, as well as a proportional-integral (PI) type of leader-follower formation guidance strategy for a group of UVs.}

abstract="Seafloor networks of cables, pipelines, and other infrastructure underpin our daily lives, providing communication links, information, and energy supplies. Despite their global importance, these networks are vulnerable to damage by a number of natural seafloor hazards, including landslides, turbidity currents, fluid flow, and scour. Conventional geophysical techniques, such as high-resolution reflection seismic and side-scan sonar, are commonly employed in geohazard assessments. These conventional tools provide essential information for route planning and design; however, such surveys provide only indirect evidence of past processes and do not observe or measure the geohazard itself. As such, many numerical-based impact models lack field-scale calibration, and much uncertainty exists about the triggers, nature, and frequency of deep-water geohazards. Recent advances in technology now enable a step change in their understanding through direct monitoring. We outline some emerging monitoring tools and how they can quantify key parameters for deepwater geohazard assessment. Repeat seafloor surveys in dynamic areas show that solely relying on evidence from past deposits can lead to an under-representation of the geohazard events. Acoustic Doppler current profiling provides new insights into the structure of turbidity currents, whereas instrumented mobile sensors record the nature of movement at the base of those flows for the first time. Existing and bespoke cabled networks enable high bandwidth, low power, and distributed measurements of parameters such as strain across large areas of seafloor. These techniques provide valuable new measurements that will improve geohazard assessments and should be deployed in a complementary manner alongside conventional geophysical tools.",

To obtain the best utilization of the underlying resources on these parts of the Earth, people have made some research advancements. Specifically, the research on underwater wireless acoustic sensor networks (UWA-SNs) has made great progress. However, wide deployment of UWA-SNs is far from a reality due to several reasons. One important reason is that offshore deployment and field-level experiments of ocean-centric applications are both expensive and labor intensive. Other alternatives to attain this objective are to conduct simulation or experimentation that can reduce cost and accelerate the research activities and their outcomes. However, designing efficient and reliable simulation and experimentation platforms have proven to be more challenging beyond the expectation. In this article, we explore the main techniques (including their pros and cons) and components to develop simulation and experimentation platforms and provide a comprehensive survey report in this area. We classify simulation and experimentation platforms based on some typical criteria and then provide useful guidelines for researchers on choosing suitable platforms in accordance with their requirements.

abstract={This paper presents the design of low cost, small autonomous surface vehicle for missions in the coastal waters and specifically for the challenging surf zone. The main objective of the vehicle design described in this paper is to address both the capability of operation at sea in relative challenging conditions and maintain a very low set of operational requirements (ease of deployment). This vehicle provides a first step towards being able to perform general purpose missions (such as data gathering or patrolling) and to at least in a relatively short distances to be able to be used in rescue operations (with very low handling requirements) such as carrying support to humans on the water. The USV is based on a commercially available fiber glass hull, it uses a directional waterjet powered by an electrical brushless motor for propulsion, thus without any protruding propeller reducing danger in rescue operations. Its small dimensions (1.5 m length) and weight allow versatility and ease of deployment. The vehicle design is described in this paper both from a hardware and software point of view. A characterization of the vehicle in terms of energy consumption and performance is provided both from test tank and operational scenario tests. An example application in search and rescue is also presented and discussed with the integration of this vehicle in the European ICARUS (7th framework) research project addressing the development and integration of robotic tools for large scale search and rescue operations.},

abstract={Autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) is a versatile marine vehicle developed to fulfill complexity requirement of wide range offshore activities. Currently, ASVs are primarily developed based on the conventional surface vessel design in term of body structure and maneuverability capability. One of the today's ASV research interests is swarming application. The conventional ASV design has a limitation where it possesses large turning radius which is less suited for swarming purpose especially for a small area application. In this paper, a new ASV prototype is developed to accommodate swarming requirement and motion stability. Firstly, design requirements and the corresponding design methodology to achieve the aforementioned objectives are discussed. The practical aspects of the design are briefly presented and some related results from experiments related to the platform testing are presented. At the end of this paper, some future potential applications of the proposed ASV design are briefly highlighted.},

abstract={During last years unmanned ground and aerial vehicles captured the attention of researchers and companies, while the available set of Unmanned Surface Vehicle platforms is smaller. In many scenarios an integrated approach is required considering a heterogeneous fleet of vehicles. In this paper we focus on the development of a low-cost unmanned surface platform for digital surveys. The boat has been designed to navigate also in shallow water owing to a low draft design. An embedded system with Robot Operating System (ROS) onboard has been deployed on the surface vehicle. One of the main advantages of the proposed solution is its reduced cost owing to open-hardware/software solutions. In particular, an open-hardware solution is responsible for the interfacing of an RTK GPS with a bathymetric ultrasound sensor to map the sea / lake / river floor. The boat can be either remotely controllable or fully autonomous. An Augmented Reality (AR) application has been also developed to show the path and the set of survey blocks that are mapped / not mapped. The AR application is particularly useful when the user remotely controls the boat, but also for supervising the autonomous survey. The performances achieved in the first trials are satisfactory and the AR application produces significant maps.},

abstract={The accurate and precise mapping of Land Use / Land Cover (LU/LC) plays a key role in the management of a region. In particular the knowledge of areas close to rivers and / or estuaries is fundamental to prevent flooding preserving the integrity of artificial structures and natural flora and fauna. Actually the mapping is performed by processing remote sensed data with a typical GSD of 0.5m. The survey is expensive and the presence of clouds could invalidate an entire survey. This kind of survey is perfect for a monitoring over a long period while is not appropriate for a quasi real time imagery. The adoption of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a proper solution owing to the low cost and the reduced time for the setup, but it lacks of a complete view of the area. The reason is the presence of canopy that occludes the view. We integrate the images acquired by an UAV characterized by a GSD of 0.03m with an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) that collects images of the river from different point of view enhanced by an RGB-D sensor. The change detection algorithm applied to the collected data is based on a innovative hybrid classifier that fuses the benefit of pixel and object based approaches mapping the changes over a well defined temporal horizon.},

These challenges can be managed through a variety of engineering approaches. To wing payloads behind a Wave Glider provides excellent isolation from surface and mechanical noise. It also provides a persistent, long-endurance, option for sensor deployment. Numerous applications have been demonstrated using towed bodies behind Wave Gliders. In fisheries research the Wave Glider has been used to tow a multi-frequency echosounder designed to detect biomass. Gateway missions have used a towbody to deploy acoustic modems. This has supported numerous applications, including geophysical research. Results from these projects have validated the utility of both towed sensors and the Wave Glider platform.},

abstract={ AbstractA geodetic GPS receiver has been installed on a Wave Glider, an unmanned water surface vehicle. Using kinematic precise point positioning (PPP) GPS, which operates globally without directly requiring reference stations, surface heights are measured with ~0.05-m precision. The GPS Wave Glider was tested in Loch Ness, Scotland, by measuring the gradient of the loch’s surface height. The experiment took place under mild weather, with virtually no wind setup along the loch and a wave field made mostly of ripples and wavelets. Under these conditions, the loch’s surface height gradient should be approximately equal to the geoid slope. The PPP surface height gradient and that of the Earth Gravitational Model 2008 geoid heights do indeed agree on average along the loch (0.03 m km−1). Also detected are 1) ~0.05-m-sized height changes due to daily water pumping for hydroelectricity generation and 2) high-frequency (0.25–0.5 Hz) oscillations caused by surface waves. The PPP heights compare favorably (~0.02-m standard deviation) with relative carrier phase–based GPS processing. This suggests that GPS Wave Gliders have the potential to autonomously determine centimeter-precise water surface heights globally for lake modeling, and also for applications such as ocean modeling and geoid/mean dynamic topography determination, at least for benign surface states such as those encountered during the reported experiment.}}

abstract={The formation control technique called cluster space control promotes simplified specification and monitoring of the motion of mobile multirobot systems of limited size. Previous paper has established the conceptual foundation of this approach and has experimentally verified and validated its use for various systems implementing kinematic controllers. In this paper, we briefly review the definition of the cluster space framework and introduce a new cluster space dynamic model. This model represents the dynamics of the formation as a whole as a function of the dynamics of the member robots. Given this model, generalized cluster space forces can be applied to the formation, and a Jacobian transpose controller can be implemented to transform cluster space compensation forces into robot-level forces to be applied to the robots in the formation. Then, a nonlinear model-based partition controller is proposed. This controller cancels out the formation dynamics and effectively decouples the cluster space variables. Computer simulations and experimental results using three autonomous surface vessels and four land rovers show the effectiveness of the approach. Finally, sensitivity to errors in the estimation of cluster model parameters is analyzed.},

These relate to the marine robots from INESC TEC, surface (ROAZ USV) and underwater (MARES AUV) autonomous vehicles participation in multiple tasks such as situation assessment, underwater mapping, leak detection or victim localization. This participation was integrated in the ICARUS Team resulting of the EU funded project aimed to develop robotic tools for large scale disasters. The coordinated search and rescue missions were performed with an initial surface survey providing data for AUV mission planning and execution. A situation assessment bathymetry map, sidescan sonar imaging and location of structures, underwater leaks and victims were achieved, with the global ICARUS team (involving sea, air and land coordinated robots) participating in the final grand Challenge and achieving the second place.},

abstract={The development of maritime unmanned tools for search and rescue operations is not a trivial task. A great part of maritime unmanned systems developed did not target such application, being more focused on environmental monitoring, surveillance or defence. In opposition to these applications, search and rescue operations need to take into account relevant issues such as the presence of people or other vessels on the water. Building upon user requirements and overall integrated components for assisted rescue and unmanned search operations (ICARUS) system architecture, this chapter addresses the development of unmanned maritime systems. It starts with an overview of the approach where a two‐tier solution was adopted to address safety issues and then proceeds to detail each of the

On March 18, we carried out inspection mission in a damaged gymnasium. From March 19–21, we went to other sites to identify possibility of usage of robots, and we found the potential needs for not only ground robots but also underwater robots. Then, after the first activity we established a joint United States-Japanese team for underwater search. From April 19–23, 2011 the joint team brought four ROVs to Miyagi Prefecture for port inspection and to Iwate Prefecture for searching for submerged bodies. The joint team returned to Miyagi Prefecture October 22–26 with an AUV and two ROVs for cooperative debris mapping needed to assist with resuming fishing. Based on these experiences, we discuss the effectiveness and problems of applying the rescue robot in the real disaster sites.",

Powerful permanent magnets imbedded in each foot allow the robot to hang from a steel ceiling powerlessly. Although the magnets are passive, the attractive force is modulated by tilting the foot against the steel surface. This allows the robot to slide its feet along the surface using Â¿MoonwalkÂ¿ and Â¿ShuffleÂ¿ gait patterns. The robot can also detach its feet and swing them over small obstacles. These diverse walking patterns are created with a single servoed joint and 2 sets of simple locking mechanisms. Kinematic and static conditions are obtained for the under-actuated legged robot to perform each gait pattern safely and stably. A proof-of-concept prototype robot is designed, built, and tested. Experiments demonstrate the feasibility of the design concept and verify the analytical results.},

abstract={Global initiatives are underway to establish Ocean Observing Systems (OOS) that can provide society better information on ocean conditions. These observatories include moorings, drifters, floats, and buoyancy gliders. Although gliders have long operational endurance, their reliance on batteries limits sensors payloads, thus some OOS also include autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) with active propulsion. In some observatories AUVs can recharge their batteries at underwater docking stations connected to shore by cables. However AUVs can also be recharged from autonomous surface vessels (ASVs) such as the WaveGlider, whose propulsion is provided by wave action, and payload power supplied by solar panels. In addition to this function, as components of OOS, ASVs can collect data and act as communication nodes for data from bottom moorings, gliders and AUVs. Unmanned air vehicle systems (UAS) may perform the same role. The problem of networking these heterogeneous systems is discussed along with tools and technologies for adaptive ocean sampling. A vision is outlined to build a portable mobile observatory for OOS which can be deployed anywhere, anytime, that relies on a mix of human-in-the-loop and fully autonomous computational technology.},

abstract={Unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) are a technology of increasing importance within the military, scientific, and commercial communities. The use of these vehicles ranges all the way from hydrological and bathymetric surveying to port and harbor defense and security. Increasingly, these systems are becoming more autonomous and equipped for a wider variety of tasks. Work in recent years has explored using these platforms for disaster response and recovery, as well as port and harbor inspection after natural disasters and catastrophic events. In cases such as these it is of great importance that the platform being used has an array of robust navigational capabilities.
This thesis presents the development of a basic lumped-parameter model for the Unmanned Port Security Vessel (UPSV), an autonomous platform for inspecting ports and harbors. This model is used to refine basic control methods such as heading and velocity, as well as line following control techniques. The line of sight (LOS) control algorithm, a very common technique for line following, is presented as well as a new method of line following control called the Alpha line following technique. These control methods are implemented in simulation and the effects of varying system parameters are reported. Further comparison of these control techniques is made through experimental results obtained from field surveys. Finally, the model is validated through comparison of the experimental data to simulations conducted using the same mission inputs. The overall capability of the model and the line following control techniques is discussed.},

abstract={The following addresses the control of an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) to follow the trajectory made by an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) when the last is performing any given pre-programmed mission. In fact, it has been proved to be of great interest to have an ASV that could follow on the surface and even catch up the trajectory performed by the AUV, when executing a given mission. In order to achieve this desired coordinated motion between AUV and ASV, it would make sense just to program each of the vehicles with the same mission. However, due to the nature of vehicles, missions and also due to the localization system used, with this kind of solution some problems would arise, namely related with timings and synchronization, which are indeed difficult to overcome. The solution proposed here tries to estimate the AUV position, by tapping the signals exchanged between the former and each of the beacons of the acoustic localization network, and control and actuate the ASV in accordance.},

abstract={The sea as a very extensive area, renders difficult a pre-emptive and long-lasting search for shipwreck survivors. The operational cost for deploying manned teams with such proactive strategy is high and, thus, these teams are only reactively deployed when a disaster like a shipwreck has been communicated. To reduce the involved financial costs, unmanned robotic systems could be used instead as background surveillance teams patrolling the seas. In this sense, a robotic team for search and rescue (SAR) operations at sea is presented in this work. Composed of an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) piggybacking a watertight Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) with vertical take-off and landing capabilities, the proposed cooperative system is capable of search, track and provide basic life support while reporting the position of human survivors to better prepared manned rescue teams. The USV provides long-range transportation of the UAV and basic survival kits for victims. The UAV assures an augmented perception of the environment due to its high vantage point.},

abstract={ Objective:We investigated the effects of level of agent transparency on operator performance, trust, and workload in a context of human–agent teaming for multirobot management.Background:Participants played the role of a heterogeneous unmanned vehicle (UxV) operator and were instructed to complete various missions by giving orders to UxVs through a computer interface. An intelligent agent (IA) assisted the participant by recommending two plans—a top recommendation and a secondary recommendation—for every mission.Method:A within-subjects design with three levels of agent transparency was employed in the present experiment. There were eight missions in each of three experimental blocks, grouped by level of transparency. During each experimental block, the IA was incorrect three out of eight times due to external information (e.g., commander’s intent and intelligence). Operator performance, trust, workload, and usability data were collected.Results:Results indicate that operator performance, trust, and perceived usability increased as a function of transparency level. Subjective and objective workload data indicate that participants’ workload did not increase as a function of transparency. Furthermore, response time did not increase as a function of transparency.Conclusion:Unlike previous research, which showed that increased transparency resulted in increased performance and trust calibration at the cost of greater workload and longer response time, our results support the benefits of transparency for performance effectiveness without additional costs.Application:The current results will facilitate the implementation of IAs in military settings and will provide useful data to the design of heterogeneous UxV teams. }

This program is being coordinated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and will result in consensus standards developed through ASTM International, under the Operational Equipment Subcommittee of their Homeland Security Committee. The first phase of the program involved definition of requirements by subject matter experts. Responders participated in a series of workshops to identify deployment categories for robots, performance categories, and ranges of acceptable or target performance in the various categories. Over one hundred individual requirements were identified, within main categories such as Human-System Interaction, Logistics, Operating Environment, and System (which includes Chassis, Communications, Mobility, Payload, Power, and Sensing). To ensure that the robot developers and eventual end users work closely together, "responders meet robots" events at situationally relevant sites are being held to refine and extend the performance requirements and develop standard test methods. The results of these standard performance tests will be captured in a compendium of existing and developmental robots with classifications and descriptors to differentiate particular robotic capabilities. This, along with ongoing efforts to categorize situational USAR constraints such as building collapse types or the presence of hazardous materials, will help responders match particular robotic capabilities to response needs. In general, these efforts will enable responders to effectively use robotic tools to enhance their effectiveness while reducing risk to personnel during disasters.},

The limited spatial coverage and relative infrequency of such surveys compromise their value to fisheries managers. The Liquid Robotics Wave Glider allows scientists to collect data in a wider range of weather conditions and using fewer man-hours than typical shipboard acoustic surveys while operating at a greatly reduced cost. As part of an NSF-sponsored research project, Cornell University, BioSonics, Inc. and Liquid Robotics collaborated to design and manufacture a custom tow-body containing a specially modified dual-frequency BioSonics echosounder with 70-kHz and 200-kHz transducers. The tow body was attached to the submerged glider unit of a Liquid Robotics Wave Glider with a compliant tow cable to provide mechanical isolation between the Wave Glider and the tow body. Liquid Robotics conducted a series of tests in Kealakekua Bay, Hawaii, during March 2011 and March 2012 with the goal of evaluating the ability of the system to detect the mesopelagic boundary community's (MBC) offshore to onshore and upward vertical migration. The system was shown to be an effective method for collecting high-quality acoustic data for studying patterns in the distribution and migration of marine organisms. It also holds great promise for applications oriented towards continuous assessment of commercial fish stocks and the monitoring of marine ecosystem health.},

abstract="Submarine landslides constitute a geohazard to humans and their infrastructures. Recent studies, supported by the rapid advances in seafloor mapping technology, have shown that submarine landslides are important geological processes in terms of their widespread occurrence, their size and the volume of sediment they displace. Submarine mass movement processes are, however, poorly understood. The investigation of submarine landslides still presents a challenge to marine geomorphologists today because of their large scale and inaccessibility. The type of information on submarine landslides that is available to the marine geoscientist is generally morphological and acquired remotely. For these reasons, geomorphological mapping has become an important tool in the study of submarine landslides. In this chapter, I review the methods used by marine geomorphologists to generate geomorphological maps of submarine landslides, assess the characteristics of these maps and suggest ways in which they can be improved. I will also demonstrate the utility of geomorphological mapping in assessing the risk associated with an offshore gas field development and in improving our understanding of submarine landslide dynamics in the Storegga Slide off the Norwegian coast."

abstract={The overall objective of this work is to evaluate the ability of homing and docking an unmanned underwater vehicle (Hydroid REMUS 100 UUV) to a moving unmanned surface vehicle (Wave-Adaptive Modular Surface Vehicle USV) using a Hydroid Digital Ultra-Short Baseline (DUSBL) acoustic positioning system (APS), as a primary navigation source. An understanding of how the UUV can rendezvous with a stationary platform first is presented in this paper. Inherently, the DUSBL-APS is susceptible to error due to the physical phenomena of the underwater acoustic channel (e.g. ambient noise, attenuation and ray refraction). The development of an APS homing simulator model has allowed the authors to forecast the UUV's position and the estimated track line of the USV as determined by the DUSBL acoustic sensor. The model also provides the associated cross-track (horizontal), down-range (vertical), and along-range (projected) body-fixed errors to be expected in discrete periods of time for any sound velocity profile. In this model, focus is placed on three main elements: 1) the acoustic channel and sound ray refraction when propagating in an in-homogeneous medium; 2) the detection component of an ideal DUSBL-APS using the Neyman-Pearson criterion; 3) the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and receiver directivity impact on position estimation. The simulation tool is compared against actual open water homing results in terms of the estimated source position between the simulated and the actual USBL range and bearing information.},

The envisioned scenario for this marsupial system is unmanned recovery of objects floating at the sea surface. The specific mission that is addressed in this paper includes the following phases: coarse approach where the USV approaches the object area using navigation filter based on GPS measurements; fine approach where the UAV tracking the USV sends relative distances between the USV and the object which is visible in the UAV's field of view; and tugging where the USV takes the object to safety after the initial contact has been achieved. The paper describes the ROS-based control architecture, presents simulation results, and addresses control issues related to obtaining measurements from two sources with different variances.},

abstract={The high-risk nature of SCUBA diving activities is usually dealt with by pairing up divers and adopting well defined rules for diving operations to reduce the chance of accidents. However, during more challenging dives (such as technical dives) these procedures may not be sufficient to ensure almost accident-free operations, for the divers must manoeuvre in complex 3D environments, carry cumbersome equipment, and focus attention on operational details. Technological advancement and research related to diver safety, navigation and monitoring has been identified as crucial for advancing diving activities. This paper reports current state of research performed at UNIZG-FER related to an autonomous overactuated surface platform used for following divers and transmitting GPS signal to the underwater. The implemented guidance and control algorithms are described and simulations obtained on realistic models developed in the ROS environment are provided. Special attention is given to algorithms for diver tracking by using measurements from a USBL. Diver motion estimators are used to improve the performance of the sparse and noisy USBL measurements. The results presented in this paper are a starting point for in-the-field experiments expected to take place in the real-world environment.},

abstract={Diving is a high-risk activity due to the hazardous environment, dependence on technical equipment for life support, complexity of underwater navigation, and limited monitoring from the surface. This article describes a new concept of using an autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) as a private satellite that tracks divers, thus significantly increasing diving safety. Since the vehicle is above the diver at all times, acoustic communication with the diver interface in the form of an underwater tablet is more efficient and robust, which enhances diver navigation and enables reliable monitoring from the surface. This article focuses on a diver-tracking control structure that uses a diver motion estimator to determine diver position, even in cases when acoustic position measurements are not available.},

Given the fast growing technological progress in these fields, robots can offer a wide range of applications.

Therefore, middleware services provide a novel approach offering many possibilities and drastically enhancing the application development for robots.

abstract={We propose a method for controlling multiple active drifters in the presence of external forcing induced by the ocean. Our active drifters have one actuator: they can lower and raise their drogues in depth. By exploiting the vertically stratified nature of ocean currents, we show how classical multi-robot tasks (spreading out and aggregation) can be accomplished by the multi-drifter system. Tests with a realistic simulation based on an ocean model suggest that a practical implementation of active drifters which aggregate and disperse in the coastal ocean could be realized through our control method with relatively inexpensive components. Specifically, we are able to show that over a 90 day deployment a significant fraction of drifters can be made to aggregate in few clusters suitable for recovery.},

In this review we present a culturally valid mental health action plan based on scienti.c evidence that is capable of addressing the mental health effects of complex emergencies. A mental health system of primary care providers, traditional healers, and relief workers, if properly trained and supported, can provide cost-effective, good mental health care. This plan emphasises the need for standardised approaches to the assessment, monitoring, and outcome of all related activities. Crucial to the improvement of outcomes during crises and the availability to future emergencies of lessons learned from earlier crises is the regular dissemination of the results achieved with the action plan. A research agenda is included that should, in time, fill knowledge gaps and reduce the negative mental health effects of complex emergencies. "

month={September},
year={2018},
abstract={For more than a decade, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been used on construction job sites for a variety of purposes including structural inspection, and 3D mapping of the site and existing structures. Although the advantages that UAVs have brought to construction are discussed extensively in the literature, applications of other types of unmanned vehicles (UVs) in the construction industry, including unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs), unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) (operating on water surfaces), and unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), have received limited attention.
Although UAVs are the most frequently employed type of UVs in the construction industry, UGVs and USVs have also been involved in a few construction- related missions. These include search operations and structural damage assessment in the aftermath of disasters such as the World Trade Center in 2001, Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant in 2011, Hurricane Wilma in 2005 and Hurricane Ike in 2008. UGVs and USVs have rarely been used in any other type of construction-related application. Furthermore, there is no available data about construction-related applications of UUVs.
Recent advances in information technology and artificial intelligence have led to the design of autonomous UAVs, UGVs, USVs and UUVs that can operate without, or with little, human intervention in their missions. Advances in UVs and their automated control have resulted in commercially available prototypes of different types of UVs. This, in turn, has created an unexplored potential for the applications of a wide variety of UVs to construction. This paper reviews this potential specifically for USVs, UUVs and UGVs. The details of each mission, including application, UVs type and details of mission are described. The paper concludes with an identification of gaps in the current technology where developments are required before the full potential of USVs, UUVs, and UGVs can be achieved in construction.},

year={2017},

pages={1-7},
abstract={Drones in general have become increasingly popular, mainly due to its cost attractive and popularization. At this stage, drones' technology is providing a new set of applications and services specially in the field of aquatic drones which can be used for numerous applications (e.g, sea life localization and environmental monitoring, bridges inspection, sea border patrolling...). Most of the Earth surface is covered by water, and therefore, aquatic drones can become great assets in aquatic environment monitoring tasks. Thus, it is of crucial importance to guarantee a persistent and reliable communication network to assure the drones' self-control, as well as to make sure that environmental data collected from sensors can reach the fixed gateway placed ashore. In this work we propose a mechanism to calculate and assess the link quality between aquatic drones based on the signal strength, stability of the connection and its bandwidth. This quality evaluation mechanism is then integrated in the routing process of a Delay Tolerant Network (DTN) for an efficient transportation of data among the aquatic drones. Having the quality mechanism as baseline, three routing strategies were proposed: i) routing through the first neighboring contact, ii) routing through the best quality contact, and iii) routing through the best quality contact to the gateway. To evaluate the performance of the proposed routing strategies, a set of evaluations were performed using real aquatic scenarios with movement. The results have shown that the strategy "best quality contact to the gateway" presents the highest delivery ratio when compared to other routing strategies.},

title={PORTABLE INSTRUMENTATION FOR REAL-TIME MEASUREMENT OF SCOUR AT BRIDGES},
year={2000},
publisher={Highway Administration Publication No. FHWA-RD-99-085, Turner-Fairbank Highway Research Center, McLean, VA},
abstract={Portable scour-measuring systems were developed to meet the requirements of three different applications: bridge inspections, limited-detail data collection, and detailed data collection. A portable scour-measuring system consists of four components: (a) the instrument(s) for making the measurement, (2) a system for deploying the instrument(s), (3) a method to identify and record the horizontal position of the data collected, and (4) a data-storage device. Commercially available instruments were evaluated for use in measuring scour at bridges during floods. The systems developed consist primarily of commercially available instruments, which were modified and interfaced to achieve the required functionality. The bridge-inspection system is intended for use by bridge inspectors to measure the streambed elevation around piers and abutments to ensure the stability of bridge foundations. The system developed and described here uses a low-cost echo sounder to measure the water depth and a tethered float to deploy the transducer around the bridge piers and abutments. Data are recorded on a chart-recording echo sounder or in a notebook if the echo sounder has only a graphical or numerical display. The U.S. Geological Survey has been collecting limited-detail data on scour at bridges for several years. The only additional development for limited-detail data collection was to use a float to deploy the transducer of an echo sounder, which allows data to be collected beneath the bridge and along the sides of the piers. The detailed data collection system allows collection of detailed channel bathymetry and hydraulic data at the bridge and in the approach and exit reaches. Channel geometry is measured using a digital echo sounder; three-dimensional velocity profiles are collected using a broadband acoustic Doppler current profiler (BB-ADCP); and the position of the data collected is measured using either a range-azimuth positioning system or a differential global positioning system. All data are transmitted to shore where they are stored on a field computer. Because of the spatial coverage required of detailed data, the instruments must be deployed from a boat. Although manned boats are frequently used on some streams, safety and access considerations, particularly on small streams, led to the development of a remote-control boat. The remote-control boat consists of a flat-bottom jon boat powered by an outboard engine with servos and switches mounted directly on the engine to allow control of the engine by use of standard recreational remote controls. All systems developed have been used successfully during major floods and allow data to be collected more efficiently and in more detail than was previously possible.},

abstract={ The Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue has collected data at three responses (World Trade Center, Hurricane Charley, and the La Conchita mudslide) and nine high fidelity field exercises. Our results can be distilled into four lessons. First, building situation awareness, not autonomous navigation, is the major bottleneck in robot autonomy. Most of the robotics literature assumes a single operator single robot (SOSR), while our work shows that two operators working together are nine times more likely to find a victim. Second, human-robot interaction should not be thought of how to control the robot but rather how a team of experts can exploit the robot as an active information source. The third lesson is that team members use shared visual information to build shared mental models and facilitate team coordination. This suggests that high bandwidth, reliable communications will be necessary for effective teamwork. Fourth, victims and rescuers in close proximity to the robots respond to the robot socially. We conclude with observations about the general challenges in human-robot interaction. }

Assistance was provided by the National Science Foundation's industry/university cooperative research center on safety security rescue technologies. The AEOS-1 USV was prototype built for environmental science studies. It was modified to carry a Sound Metric Dual frequency IDentification SONar (DIDSON). The DIDSON was able to show the state of underwater structures, schools of small fish swimming, and find the railings from the collapsed section of a pier. This work validates the concept of using USVs and UAVs together for disaster response, suggests missions, and priorities for autonomy. Besides damage inspection, USV-UAV teams can find safe lanes of sea travel and to detect hazardous materials spills. In addition to providing situation awareness, the UAV can serve as a wireless network relay. Inspection of damage to seawalls, docks, and bridges requires vision above the waterline as well as below poses a new type of Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM).},

Three days later, the Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue at the University of South Florida deployed an iSENYS helicopter and a prototype unmanned water surface vehicle, AEOS-1, to survey damage in parts of Marco Island, 14 km from landfall. The effort was the first known use of unmanned sea surface vehicles (USVs) for emergency response and established their suitability for the recovery phase of disaster management by detecting damage to seawalls and piers, locating submerged debris (moorings and handrails), and determining safe lanes for sea navigation. It provides a preliminary domain theory of postdisaster port and littoral inspection with unmanned vehicles for use by the human–robot interaction community. It was also the first known demonstration of the strongly heterogeneous USV–micro aerial vehicle (MAV) team for any domain. The effort identified cooperative UAV–USV strategies and open issues for autonomous operations near structures. The effort showed that the MAV provided a much-needed external view for situation awareness and provided spotting for areas to be inspected. Concepts of operations for USV damage inspection and USV–MAV cooperation emerged, including a formula for computing the human–robot ratio: Nh=(2 × Nv) + 1, where Nh is the number of humans and Nv is the number of vehicles. The outstanding research issues span three areas: challenges for USVs operating near littoral structures, general issues for USV–MAV cooperation, and new applications. It is expected that the lessons learned will be transferrable to defense and homeland safety and security applications, such as port security, and other phases of emergency response, including rescue. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={This paper describes the deployment of the custom Sea-RAI man-portable unmanned surface vehicle and two commercially available underwater vehicles (the autonomous YSI EcoMapper and the tethered VideoRay) for inspection of the Rollover Pass bridge in the Bolivar peninsula of Texas, which was damaged during Hurricane Ike. The Sea-RAI successfully performed the two key tasks in subsurface bridge inspection using a DIDSON acoustic camera: mapping of the debris field and inspecting the bridge footings for scour. The deployment identified three challenges for unmanned marine vehicle control: navigation under loss of GPS, underwater obstacle avoidance, and stable positioning in high currents without GPS. The field work also illustrated the advantages of surface and underwater vehicles working cooperatively. Improvements for human-robot interaction were suggested, including having additional display units so that mission specialists can view and operate on imagery independently of the operator control unit, incorporating 2-way audio to allow operator and field personnel to communicate while launching or recovering the vehicle, and the inclusion of teleoperation as the backup mode for autonomy. The effort helps establish the domain of bridge inspection and the findings are expected to assist in the design and development of unmanned marine systems for littoral inspection.},

abstract={Three underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) were used over a five day period to inspect critical infrastructure and to assist with victim search and recovery at six sites in the Iwate Prefecture following the Tohoku Earthquake and Tsunami. Unmanned marine vehicles have been used since 2004 for disaster recovery operations but in limited applications, in single areas, and in short deployment durations. The joint IRS-CRASAR deployment matched robots for missions specified by civilian municipalities and the Japanese Coast Guard. The ROVs successfully allowed a fishing port to be re-opened and searched for victims trapped underwater in five different locations in varying areas (marinas, bridge debris, and waterfront residential areas) that could not be searched by manual divers. From a scientific perspective, the deployment provides a corpus of 15 hours of data of how rescue robots can be used. It illustrates that rescue robots are i) valuable for both economic and victim recovery, not just response, ii) that disaster robots need to be optimized for the unique missions and stakeholder needs, and iii) that human-robot interaction remains a challenge. This paper also identifies new areas for research: computer vision and cognitive engineering, cyber-physical systems, heterogeneous multi-robot coordination, human-robot interaction, simulation and geographical information systems.},

In the exercise, a small robot with two-way video and audio communication was inserted into a physically simulated building collapse next to a trapped victim, and was provided to a team of trained responders as a means for performing remote triage and victim monitoring. The interaction between the responders and the victim was examined, with emphasis on how the responders adapted to different video and audio capabilities, and how they might have responded to different populations and injuries that may limit communication. The ad hoc interaction protocols used by the responders were observed in the field exercise, and four interaction schemes were identified: Two-way Video with Two-way Audio, One-way Video (from Robot to Responders) with Two-way Audio, Two-way Video with no Audio, and One-way Video (from Robot to Responders) with no audio. The interaction schemes are defined according to the minimum capabilities of the robot and victim, the requirements of the responders, and preliminary protocols required for each interaction scheme. From observations made about the exercise, the paper identifies minimalistic interfaces and transparency of robot state as key areas for improving a robot-mediated interaction between responders and victims.},

abstract={This book offers the definitive guide to the theory and practice of disaster robotics. It can serve as an introduction for researchers and technologists, a reference for emergency managers, and a textbook in field robotics. Written by a pioneering researcher in the field who has herself participated in fifteen deployments of robots in disaster response and recovery, the book covers theory and practice, the history of the field, and specific missions. After a broad overview of rescue robotics in the context of emergency informatics, the book provides a chronological summary and formal analysis of the thirty-four documented deployments of robots to disasters that include the 2001 collapse of the World Trade Center, Hurricane Katrina, the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami, and numerous mining accidents. It then examines disaster robotics in the typical robot modalities of ground, air, and marine, addressing such topics as robot types, missions and tasks, and selection heuristics for each modality. Finally, the book discusses types of fieldwork, providing practical advice on matters that include collecting data and collaborating with emergency professionals. The field of disaster robotics has lacked a comprehensive overview. This book by a leader in the field, offering a unique combination of the theoretical and the practical, fills the gap.},

This paper presents the first set of experimental results of the USV which have recently been carried out at Roadford Reservoir, Devon, UK. An online genetic algorithm based model predictive controller (GA-MPC) has been utilised. The experiments were initially conducted using an umbilical attached to the vehicle as a means of transmitting controller demands to the motors. This was later removed and full autonomous tests were carried out and a comparison is made. A waypoint guidance strategy was also integrated with the GA- MPC autopilot and the vehicle was launched in a fully autonomous mode. The results shown demonstrate the capability of the autopilot to generate control demands in order to cope with external disturbances and modelling uncertainty."

abstract="The aim of this paper is to report the preliminary development of an automatic collision avoidance technique for unmanned marine craft based on standardised rules, COLREGs, defined by the International Maritime Organisation. It is noted that all marine surface vessels are required to adhere to COLREGs at all times in order to minimise or eliminate the risk of collisions. The approach presented is essentially a reactive path planning algorithm which provides feedback to the autopilot of an unmanned vessel or the human captain of a manned ship for steering the craft safely. The proposed strategy consists of waypoint guidance by line-of-sight coupled with a manual biasing scheme. This is applied to the dynamic model of an unmanned surface vehicle. A simple PID autopilot is incorporated to ensure that the vessel adheres to the generated seaway. It is shown through simulations that the resulting scheme is able to generate viable trajectories in the presence of both stationary and dynamic obstacles. Rules 8 and 14 of the COLREGs, which apply to the amount of manoeuvre and to a head-on scenario respectively are simulated. A comparison is also made with an offline or deliberative grid-based path planning algorithm which has been modified to generate COLREGs-compliant routes."

Before delivering a robot to TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Company), we needed to solve some technical issues and add some functions to respond to this crisis. Therefore, we began a redesign project to equip the robot for disaster response missions. TEPCO gave us two specific missions. One was to explore the inside and outside of the reactor buildings to perform dose measurements. The other one was to sample contaminated water and install a water gauge in the basement of the reactor buildings. To succeed in the above two missions, we redesigned our mobile robot, Quince, and performed repeated operational test to improve it. Finally, one of the robots was delivered to the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station on June 20, 2011. In this paper, we will introduce the requirements for the above two missions and report how we fulfilled them.},

abstract={This thesis addresses the feasibility of using Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) in conducting Humanitarian Assistance/Disaster Relief (HA/DR) operations and analyzes the suite of LCS mission packages in conducting HA/DR operations through a Systems Engineering study. The current preference for HA/DR operations is on using big  decks, e.g., Amphibious Ship and Aircraft Carriers to maximize the lift capability of supplies, such as medical supplies, food, and water. The trade-off of using big  decks instead of small ships such as the LCS is to forfeit speed and the ability to dock nearer to shore, yet having the fuel capacity to travel long distances, and also the capacity to carry large loads of supplies. The thesis focuses on two main areas. The first is to study the feasibility of the LCS to conduct HA/DR operations. The second is to study the HA/DR operations functional allocation, and propose possible Concepts of Operations (CONOPs) and mission package for the LCS to effectively carry out the operations.}}

Unfortunately, no matter how well prepared it has its limits. The key to solving this problem lies in intelligent action coordinated between man and machine. Thus, there is need to undertake a technological bridge between people, machines and methods of intervention in emergencies. Therefore, research efforts in recent years have been focused mainly on the satisfaction of human needs replacement staff for the execution of high-risk missions in difficult environments with controlled accelerated progress in the field of mechatronics, optoelectronics, electronics computing power and allowed the market providing specialized technologies required to achieve this goal. One solution is the development of families of robots specialized for prevention and intervention, capable of movement in critical areas before the emergency to be unleashed and out of control, to save life and property or to obtain a detailed view transmitting data and information necessary human an effective response."

A "bridge inspection robot" has been developed with the aim of checking the safety status of a real bridge, gathering accurate data and performing maintenance. The developed robot system is composed of the specially designed car for bridge inspection, the guide rail and the inspection robot. Especially, this paper emphasizes the system integration method to design and control the entire robot system. As a result, this robot has both automatic and manual modes for inspecting a real bridge. In other words, the robot is automatically able to inspect beneath the bridges and manually to inspect them by long-distance user. Also, the users can see the operating conditions of long-distance robot with 3-dimensional graphical user interface. Moreover, the users can feel the operating status of long-distance robot through haptic device.},

We have implemented a Wave Glider-based payload called Hot Spot that creates a disruption-tolerant communications network between shore and at-sea autonomous platforms. The Hot Spot uses multiple radio and acoustic modems and software to implement a store-and-forward network; the system reliably transfers data between the at-sea Wave Glider Hot Spot, Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV's), benthic instrument packages, and computers on shore. Hot Spot achieves this reliability in an environment where communication links are often unpredictably disrupted. Onboard Hot Spot applications use these capabilities to acoustically determine the location of multiple underwater targets, and can autonomously direct the Wave Glider to follow a moving underwater object. We describe deployments during which Hot Spot quickly transferred science and engineering data between multiple vehicles and shore, and where the Wave Glider used its Hot Spot acoustic tracking application to autonomously follow a moving submerged AUV as part of a large biochemical science campaign.},

abstract={ This article describes the design methodology for a network of robotic Lagrangian floating sensors designed to perform real-time monitoring of water flow, environmental parameters, and bathymetry of shallow water environments (bays, estuarine, and riverine environments). Unlike previous Lagrangian sensors which passively monitor water velocity, the sensors described in this article can actively control their trajectory on the surface of the water and are capable of inter-sensor communication. The addition of these functionalities enables Lagrangian sensing in obstacle-encumbered environments, such as rivers. The Ishikawa cause and effect design framework is used to ensure that the final system synthesizes the diverse operational and functional needs of multiple end-user groups to arrive at a broadly applicable system design. A summary of potential applications for the system is given including completed projects performed on behalf of the Department of Homeland Security, Office of Naval Research, and the California Bay-Delta Authority. }

abstract={On the construction of Kanda port in Fukuoka prefecture, many harmful chemical bombs have been discovered beneath the sea bottom and they are needed to be dug up carefully and quickly as possible. So our group is trying to develop a new sub-bottom interferometric synthetic aperture imaging sonar (sub-bottom interferometric SAS) system to recognize chemical bombs as centimeters-resolution 3D-sub-bottom acoustic image. In this R&D study, it is the reasonable methodology to use an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) which can survey the seafloor with sub-bottom interferometric SAS transmitter and receiver at a constant height. To accomplish this R&D goal, positioning AUV accurately is needed, so we are trying to develop the technique which minimizes the error of positioning, using autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) which tracks AUV and surveys its absolute position by super short-baseline (SSBL) method. In development of tracking ASV, it is important to develop the controlling algorism which orders ASV to steer stably and control adequately its velocity according to the result of SSBL positioning of the AUV. Based on machine learning method, we are trying to develop an algorism which infers appropriate control of ASV from precious controlling log. Implementation of this algorism will improve the precision of underwater positioning. This paper reports the development status of our ASV and controlling algorism.},

abstract={There have been much technological advances and research in Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV) as a support and delivery platform for Autonomous/Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (AUV/UUV) or Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV). Advantages include extending underwater search and survey operations time and reach, improving underwater positioning and mission awareness, in addition to minimizing the costs and risks associated with similar manned vessel operations. The objective of this paper is to present the design and development a high-level fuzzy logic guidance controller for a WAM-V 14 unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in order to autonomously launch and recover a REMUS 100 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV). The approach to meeting this objective is to develop ability for the USV to intercept and rendezvous with an AUV that is in transit in order to maximize the probability of a final mobile docking maneuver. Specifically, a fuzzy logic Rendezvous-Docking controller has been developed that generates Waypoint-Heading goals for the USV to minimize the cross-track errors between the USV and AUV. A subsequent fuzzy logic Waypoint-Heading controller has been developed to provide the desired heading and speed commands to the low-level controller given the Waypoint-Heading goals. High-level mission control has been extensively simulated using Matlab and partially characterized in real-time during testing. Detailed simulation, experimental results and findings will be reported in this paper.},

abstract={In this paper, a neurodynamics-based output feedback scheme is proposed for distributed containment maneuvering of marine vessels guided by multiple parameterized paths without using velocity measurements. Each vessel is subject to internal model uncertainties and external disturbances induced by wind, waves, and ocean currents. In order to recover unmeasured velocity information as well as to identify unknown vessel dynamics, an echo state network (ESN) based observer using recorded input-output data is proposed for each vessel. Based on the observed velocity information of neighboring vessels, distributed containment maneuvering laws are developed at the kinematic level. Next, in order to shape the transient motion profile for vessel kinetics to follow, finite-time nonlinear tracking differentiators are employed to generate smooth reference signals as well as to extract the time derivatives of kinematic control laws. Finally, ESN-based dynamic control laws are constructed at the kinetic level. The stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed via input-to-state stability and cascade theory. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed neurodynamics-based output feedback approach.},

abstract={Oceanographers have long dreamed of a detailed, 4-D view of the ocean. The last decade has witnessed a revolution in autonomous ocean observing capabilities as new platforms and sensors developed, and rapidly matured. As these systems become fully operational, and integrated with other components of the ocean observing system, oceanographers will move closer to realizing this dream. The new generation of oceanographic platforms has been characterized as “autonomous” because the platforms operate—tracking water masses, recording oceanographic properties, and transmitting data home via satellite telemetry—without a tether to either the seafloor or a ship. Autonomous platforms are diverse in their mechanisms and rates of motion; mission payloads, ranges and durations; and capabilities to change sampling parameters during a mission either by receiving commands from home or by using on-board, decision-making tools. The platforms encompass Lagrangian surface drifters, neutrally buoyant and profiling floats, highly controllable self-propelled AUVs (Autonomous Underwater Vehicles), and underwater gliders that adjust their buoyancy to glide forward through the ocean in a saw-tooth pattern. Each platform genre has its own optimum sampling domain, capability to incorporate sensors, and unique potential to contribute to sustained observation of the ocean, such as the U.S. Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS).},

Currently, the majority number of current bridge inspections are done manually by inspectors which require significant amount of human resources along with expensive and specialized equipment. Moreover, it is difficult and dangerous for inspectors to inspect large bridges with high structures. In this paper, we propose a new design and implementation of a robotic system that can be used for steel bridge inspection. The robot consists of four magnetic wheels which create adhesion to steel surface. It is able to carry multiple sensors for navigation and mapping. Collected data are sent to the ground station for live monitoring as well as further processing. In addition, magnetic field and range sensors are also integrated to enable robot to move safely on steel surfaces. Results with physical tests on real steel structures are shown to validate the feasibility of robot design.},

abstract="This paper describes path re-planning techniques and underwater obstacle avoidance for unmanned surface vehicle (USV) based on multi-beam forward looking sonar (FLS). Near-optimal paths in static and dynamic environments with underwater obstacles are computed using a numerical solution procedure based on an A* algorithm. The USV is modeled with a circular shape in 2 degrees of freedom (surge and yaw). In this paper, two-dimensional (2-D) underwater obstacle avoidance and the robust real-time path re-planning technique for actual USV using multi-beam FLS are developed. Our real-time path re-planning algorithm has been tested to regenerate the optimal path for several updated frames in the field of view of the sonar with a proper update frequency of the FLS. The performance of the proposed method was verified through simulations, and sea experiments. For simulations, the USV model can avoid both a single stationary obstacle, multiple stationary obstacles and moving obstacles with the near-optimal trajectory that are performed both in the vehicle and the world reference frame. For sea experiments, the proposed method for an underwater obstacle avoidance system is implemented with a USV test platform. The actual USV is automatically controlled and succeeded in its real-time avoidance against the stationary undersea obstacle in the field of view of the FLS together with the Global Positioning System (GPS) of the USV.",

Based on it, the optimal linear estimator is developed. The main idea is the derivation of a relevance factor to incorporate delayed measurements to the being estimate. The estimator is then extended for nonlinear systems. The performance of this method is tested within the simulations in MATLAB and the experiments in a real robot system.

Given the perilous nature of these tasks, autonomous robot operation is highly desirable in order to reduce the risk imposed on the human rescue team. While much work has been done on creating robotic systems that can be deployed for search and rescue, limited work has been devoted to devise efficient real-time automated planning algorithms for these tasks. In this work, we present REDHI, an efficient algorithm for solving probabilistic models of complex problems such as search and rescue. We evaluate our algorithm on the search and rescue problem using both an abstract domain representation and a semi-realistic simulator of an existing robot system. The results show that REDHI can obtain near optimal performance with negligible planning time. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={A robotic boat is moving between two points when it encounters an obstacle of unknown size. The boat must find a short path around the obstacle to resume its original course. How should the boat move when it can only sense the proximity of the obstacle, and does not have prior information about the obstacle's size? We study this problem for a robotic boat with a forward-facing sonar. We study two versions of the problem. First, we solve a simplified case when the obstacle is a rectangle of known orientation but unknown dimensions. Second, we study a more general case where an arbitrarily shaped obstacle is contained between two known parallel lines. We study the performance of the algorithms analytically using competitive analysis and present results from field experiments. The experimental setup is relevant for harbor patrol or autonomous navigation in shallow water.},

abstract={We present algorithms for environment exploration in the context of a habitat monitoring task, where the goal is to track radio-tagged invasive fish with autonomous surface or ground robots. The first task is navigation around an unknown obstacle using an input from a front-facing sonar. This capability is important for navigation on inland lakes, because plants and shallow shorelines are hard to map in advance. The second task involves energy harvesting for long-term operation. We address the problem of exploring the solar map of the environment which is used for energy-efficient navigation. For both problems, we present online algorithms and examine their performance using competitive analysis. In competitive analysis, the performance of an online algorithm is compared against the optimal offline algorithm. For obstacle avoidance, the offline algorithm knows the shape of the obstacle. For solar exploration, the offline algorithm knows the geometry of the shadow-casting objects. We obtain an $O(1)$ competitive ratio for obstacle avoidance and an $O(\log n)$ competitive ratio for solar exploration, where $n$ is the number of critical points to observe. The strategies for obstacle avoidance are validated through extensive field experiments, and the strategies for exploration are validated with simulations.},

A line of sight (LOS) based potential is used to guarantee that the vehicle stays inside a band around the direct route between two consecutive way points. A new repulsive potential with a speed-dependent component is also presented in order to get smoother obstacle avoidance trajectories.},

abstract={We present a survey on maritime object detection and tracking approaches, which are essential for the development of a navigational system for autonomous ships. The electro-optical (EO) sensor considered here is a video camera that operates in the visible or the infrared spectra, which conventionally complements radar and sonar for situational awareness at sea and has demonstrated its effectiveness over the last few years. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of various approaches of video processing for object detection and tracking in the maritime environment. We follow an approach-based taxonomy wherein the advantages and limitations of each approach are compared. The object detection system consists of the following modules: horizon detection, static background subtraction, and foreground segmentation. Each of these has been studied extensively in maritime situations and has been shown to be challenging due to the presence of background motion especially due to waves and wakes. The key processes involved in object tracking include video frame registration, dynamic background subtraction, and the object tracking algorithm itself. The challenges for robust tracking arise due to camera motion, dynamic background, and low contrast of tracked object, possibly due to environmental degradation. The survey also discusses multisensor approaches and commercial maritime systems that use EO sensors. The survey also highlights methods from computer vision research, which hold promise to perform well in maritime EO data processing. Performance of several maritime and computer vision techniques is evaluated on Singapore Maritime Dataset.},

abstract={Designing algorithms for multi-robot systems can be a complex and difficult process: the cost of such systems can be very high, collecting experimental data can be time-consuming, and individual robots may malfunction, invalidating experiments. These constraints make it very tempting to work using high-level abstractions of the robots and their environment. While these high-level models can be useful for initial design, it is important to verify techniques in more realistic scenarios that include real-world effects that may have been ignored in the abstractions. In this paper, we take a simple, coordinated, multi-robot search algorithm and illustrate problems that it encounters in environments which incorporate real-world factors, such as probabilistic target detection and positional noise. We compare the performance to that of several simple randomized approaches, which are better able to deal with these constraints. ©2007 IEEE.},

The helicopters are instructed to search a given region for survivors by measuring the temperature of each point visited in the search space using an infrared camera.

Abstract={The environmental impact of oil and gas leaks during the extraction, handling, and temporary storage of oil from offshore wells; or during the offshore transportation of oil via flow line, underwater pipeline, or tanker has never been more visible to the public – with the recent disaster in the Gulf of Mexico – yet the solutions currently available do not meet all the requirements in terms of performance and reliability. This research focuses on the problem of autonomous oil spill tracking in oceanic marine environments. We describe a sensor-based guidance, navigation, and control system (GNC) for oil spill tracking by autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) in unsteady and uncertain environments. First, we describe the design and development of a yacht-shaped ASV that can track spilled oil on the sea surface using data supplied by onboard sensors to control rudder angle and sail area for navigation. Secondly, we describe an autonomous ASV decisionmaking algorithm for target speed and direction based on a complete time history of the scanned area around the ASV by the oil detection sensor. Finally, we describe field experiments conducted at the Eigashima beach, Kobe to validate the performance of the ASV with regard to autonomous oil spill tracking using GNCS based on onboard sensors data for tracking artificial oil targets.},

The deployed cellular communication infrastructure might be partially or completely destroyed after a natural disaster. Multihop ad hoc communication is an interesting alternative to deal with the lack of communications in disaster scenarios. They have evolved since their origin, leading to different ad hoc paradigms such as MANETs, VANETs, DTNs, or WSNs. This paper presents a survey on multihop ad hoc network paradigms for disaster scenarios. It highlights their applicability to important tasks in disaster relief operations. More specifically, the paper reviews the main work found in the literature, which employed ad hoc networks in disaster scenarios. In addition, it discusses the open challenges and the future research directions for each different ad hoc paradigm. }

Different measuring vehicles are used for short-term measurements with various adaptable sensors. The operation time of these vehicles is limited to few hours. Moreover, long endurance vehicles were designed for long-term missions, generating energy from solar, wind or waves, which are suitable for low-power applications. This paper describes the conceptual design and automation aspects of an innovative ocean-going autonomously acting unmanned surface vehicle. As the vehicle should act as communication node for deep-sea communication up to 6.000 meters, the main challenge is designing a low noise vehicle with reduced motions in waves. The vehicle is supposed to operate autonomously for at least one week. Hence, a hybrid energy system has been designed using batteries and a fuel cell. The automation system allows the vehicle to solve missions in a full autonomous way with minimum operator intervention. The paper closes with aspects of the vehicle construction and first trials.},

abstract={Logistic constraints and difficulties, as well as risks and economical impact of the bathymetric measurement activity, especially in shallow water, are known matters. This activity, in fact, normally implies the presence of human conductors and operators aboard motorized craft that often have to be transported in difficult to reach places or, even worse, have to operate in sites which are dangerous or hazardous for humans such as quarry lakes, landslides, risky or contaminated areas. In certain cases environmental constraints or water depth rule out craft powered by outboard engines. aerRobotix have developed a different approach based on the use of small “unmanned” craft capable of carrying out bathymetric measurements in partial or even total autonomy. Such an innovative solution avoids risks to humans, causes no environmental pollution, reduces the number of operators involved and makes the activity much more flexible. Efficient mission management, small size, handling ease and low power consumption yield low operational costs. A profitable collaboration with Geo Survey has given the opportunity to test on field such advantages in the bathymetry operations and to integrate state-of-the-art professional instrumentation. This paper describes this new approach and the relevant lesson learned. Based on examples related to successful applications of the unmanned twin-hulled “CatOne” vessel it provides details about the characteristics and advantages that unmanned surface vehicles offer for bathymetric measurement and also for other possible applications in the environmental field.},

abstract={The design and initial testing of a wind- and solar-powered (WASP) autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) are presented. The concept vehicle is a 4.2-m length overall monohull keelboat powered by a rigid wing sail with a 5-m span. It is designed to operate in 7-10 km of wind and a maximum sea state of 2. Specific attention is placed on the aerodynamic, hydrodynamic, and systems integration aspects of the design. Rigid wing sails are shown to have superior performance to conventional cloth sails for use on ASVs owing to their higher aerodynamic efficiency and robustness. The manual design process involved in selection of the airfoil cross section for the wing sail and the resulting aerodynamic performance predictions are presented. Through mathematical derivation, the optimal angle for switching the sail configuration from an upwind/crosswind lift-generating mode to a downwind drag-generating mode is found to be 135 . To simplify implementation of the control system when operating in the lift-generating sailing mode, a control scheme that decouples heading and speed control by simply setting the wing sail to an angle of attack of 10 and independently controlling heading was used. The simulation results from a velocity prediction program (VPP) used to verify the feasibility of this control approach are presented. Initial field trials of the vehicle using the control approach with autonomous wing control and manual rudder control are presented. It is shown that the measured boat speeds and wind speed/directions are within the range of values expected from the VPP. Temperatures recorded in a thermal plume during the field trials of the ASV are shown as a function of global positioning system (GPS) location and time.},

abstract={The short-term path planning of a robotic sailboat is a specially challenging task, since the sailboat can not reach points that are directly against the wind following a straight path given by some higher-level trajectory planner. Towards solving this specific problem, this work proposes a short-term path planning method for autonomous sailboats that is capable of dealing with upwind situations. In order to accomplish this, an initial path is geometrically defined and an optimization is done over this path, using genetic algorithm. Basically, our path planning method uses the distance ranges available (longitudinal and lateral) for the maneuvering and the sailboat desired heading to generate points in-between, which are reachable given the wind restriction. The proposed method uses these path planning parameters to come up with an optimized path. Results demonstrate and verifies the feasibility and the usefulness of the method.},

This paper contributes to this by defining a new criterion for assessing path-following tasks in the planar case, that is, evaluating the performance of robots that are required to follow a desired reference path. Such criterion comes from the study of the local differential geometry of the problem. New conditions for deciding whether or not the zero locus of a given polynomial intersects the neighbourhood of a point are defined. Based on this, new algorithms are presented and tested on both simulated data and experiments conducted at sea employing an Unmanned Surface Vehicle.},

abstract = "Unmanned aerial and aquatic vehicle networks have attracted the attention of the wireless communication research community in the last decade. The low manufacturing costs for developing small unmanned vehicles and the notable developments on wireless communication technologies have made possible the design of cooperative applications involving multiple unmanned aerial and aquatic vehicles. However, the design of wireless networks, which include very dynamic and complex entities like unmanned vehicles, poses many challenges. Fortunately, unmanned aerial vehicle networks applications usually resemble those of unmanned aquatic vehicle networks such as military missions, or environmental monitoring among others. With the exception of the obvious differences in the lower layers of the wireless communications protocols, valid approaches used in the aerial medium could be easily adapted to the aquatic medium. This survey presents together the main features to take into account for designing unmanned aerial and aquatic vehicle networks with the aim to help the reader to transfer valid approaches and techniques between aerial and aquatic applications. We survey the results of more than 100 references on this topic published in international conferences and journals, and we also include the results of several bibliometric analyses in order to better present the status of the art and research directions on this scientific area."

abstract={An autonomous, profiling float called EM‐APEX was developed to provide a quantitative and comprehensive description of the ocean side of hurricane‐ocean interaction. EM‐APEX measures temperature, salinity and pressure to CTD quality and relative horizontal velocity with an electric field sensor. Three prototype floats were air‐deployed into the upper ocean ahead of Hurricane Frances (2004). All worked properly and returned a highly resolved description of the upper ocean response to a category 4 hurricane. At a float launched 55 km to the right of the track, the hurricane generated large amplitude, inertially rotating velocity in the upper 120 m of the water column. Coincident with the hurricane passage there was intense vertical mixing that cooled the near surface layer by about 2.2°C. We find consistent model simulations of this event provided the wind stress is computed from the observed winds using a high wind‐speed saturated drag coefficient.}

abstract={Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are commonly used for a variety of applications, which require launch and recovery (L&R) of the vehicle from a surface craft. Here we describe work in support of an automated recovery of an AUV from an unmanned surface vehicle (USV), whereby longer endurance / range may be achieved for such applications as underwater surveys of remote sites. This may be one of many possible complex scenarios that involve multiple unmanned autonomous vehicles of various types working together autonomously to complete a multitude of tasks, maximizing their combined performance. The AUV used in this project is the Hydroid REMUS 100. The USV, which will serve as the moving surface platform that recovers the AUV, is a 14 foot Wave Adaptive Modular Vessel (WAM-V). In order to implement this type of system, various L&R methods need to be studied and analysed. This will help define a precise working environment, in which the system will be effective. Conceptual designs of two different recovery systems have been considered. For each design, an operating environment is defined, based on the characteristics of the model. Merits of each approach are being evaluated. To do so, “simple proof of concept prototypes” are built to test the feasibility and the effectiveness of each design. Here we describe one of the methods being considered. The main areas of focus of this project are device reliability, repeatability, robustness and precision. The desired outcome of this project is to provide a clear understanding of the ideal recovery method. The results of these studies will facilitate implementation of an effective automated recovery system, aiming to achieve a high degree of autonomy.},

abstract={In this paper, a concept design for automated launch and recovery (L&R) of a small autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) from an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) is described and its feasibility is assessed through modeling and simulation. The design is being implemented on a selected catamaran USV for deployment of a REMUS 100 AUV. The concept for launch involves lowering the AUV into the water from the center of the USV while the latter is in motion. Recovery and retrieval involves aligning the two vehicles together through acoustic positioning, lowering of a thin line with an outrigger-type depressor wing from a winch on the USV, latching of the line by the AUV using a custom pincer-type onboard mechanism, and subsequent reeling of the line for vehicle retrieval. The USV being considered can operate effectively in low to moderate sea states. The length of the recovery line can be adjusted to facilitate AUV recovery from deeper locations beneath the USV in higher sea state. The L&R process is modeled in OrcaFlex to assess its feasibility and to conduct a parametric study in support of developing optimal operations of the launch and recovery system (LARS). The resulting system is being implemented on a USV.},

abstract="The growing variety and complexity of marine research and application oriented tasks requires unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) to operate fully autonomously over long time horizons even in environments with significant civilian traffic. In order to address this challenge, we have developed a lattice-based 5D trajectory planner for USVs. The planner estimates collision risk and reasons about the availability of contingency maneuvers to counteract unpredictable behaviors of civilian vessels. The planner also incorporates avoidance behaviors of the vessels into the search for a dynamically feasible trajectory to minimize collision risk. In order to be computationally efficient, it dynamically scales the control action primitives of a trajectory based on the distribution and concentration of civilian vessels while preserving the dynamical feasibility of the primitives. We present a novel congestion metric to compare the complexity of different scenarios when evaluating the performance of the planner. Our results demonstrate that the basic version of the risk and contingency-aware planner (RCAP) significantly decreases the number of collisions compared to a baseline, velocity obstacles based planner, especially in complex scenarios with a high number of civilian vessels. The adaptive version of the planner (A-RCAP) improves the computational performance of RCAP by 500{\%}. This leads to a high replanning rate, which allows shorter traversal distances and smaller arrival times, while ensuring comparable incidence of collisions.",

abstract={Robots were used at the site of the World Trade Center disaster, and they are being used to explore the interior of the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Plant (FDNP). Robots will be used at the FDNP for the next few decades, until the nuclear reactor is finally decommissioned. Wired communications systems have been used to teleoperate robots in hazardous areas where humans cannot work. In this paper, we show the fluctuation of Wi-Fi power strength in a real environment and that the fluctuations utilization is one of the key points to be considered while developing rescue robots for disaster-prone areas. We propose a simulation environment that simulates the fluctuation of the Wi-Fi power strength with a database and evaluates the performance of the robot with unstable Wi-Fi connectivity.}

The use of a team of USVs for the security of civilian harbors is the subject of an on-going research project between DIST and Selex-SI, a leading player for homeland security systems. This paper presents the latest results of the project, which are centered on the problem of intercepting a suspect vehicle.

abstract={ Underwater dam crack detection and classification based on visible images is a challenging task. The underwater environment is very complex with uneven illumination and serious noise problems, which often leads to the distortion of detection. In addition, there are few methods suitable for underwater dam crack classification. To solve these problems, a novel underwater dam crack detection and classification approach is proposed. Firstly, a dodging algorithm is used to eliminate the uneven illumination in the underwater visible images. Subsequently, a crack detection approach is proposed, where the local characteristics of image blocks and the global characteristics of connected domains are both used based on the analysis of the statistical properties of dam crack images. Finally, an improved evidence theory-based crack classification algorithm is proposed after the crack detection. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to detect underwater dam cracks and classify them accurately and effectively in complex underwater environments. }

abstract={This paper is directed towards providing an answer to the question, {''}Can you control the trajectory of a Lagrangian float?{''} Being a float that has minimal actuation (only buoyancy control), their horizontal trajectory is dictated through drifting with ocean currents. However, with the appropriate vertical actuation and utilising spatio-temporal variations in water speed and direction, we show here that broad controllabilty results can be met such as waypoint following to keep a float inside of a bay or out of a designated region. This paper extends theory experimen- tally evaluted on horizontally actuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) for trajectory control utilising ocean forecast models and presents an initial investi- gation into the controllability of these minimally actuated drifting AUVs. Simulated results for offshore coastal and within highly dynamic tidal bays illustrate two tech- niques with the promise for an affirmative answer to the posed question above. },

abstract={Establishing a persistent presence in the ocean with an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) capable of observing temporal variability of large-scale ocean processes requires a unique sensor platform. In this paper, we examine the utility of vehicles that can only control their depth in the water column for such extended deployments. We present a strategy that utilizes ocean model predictions to facilitate a basic level of autonomy and enables general control for these profiling floats. The proposed method is based on experimentally validated techniques for utilizing ocean current models to control autonomous gliders. With the appropriate vertical actuation, and utilizing spatio-temporal variations in water speed and direction, we show that general controllability results can be met. First, we apply an A* planner to a local controllability map generated from predictions of ocean currents. This computes a path between start and goal waypoints that has the highest likelihood of successful execution. A computed depth plan is generated with a model-predictive controller (MPC), and selects the depths for the vehicle so that ambient currents guide it toward the goal. Mission constraints are included to simulate and motivate a practical data collection mission. Results are presented in simulation for a mission off the coast of Los Angeles, CA, USA, that show encouraging results in the ability of a drifting vehicle to reach a desired location.},

Among the many advantages of DeepRuler, there is its ease of integration with almost every kind of robot or simulator, without much effort left on the shoulders of the software developer.

abstract={Robotics is becoming part of our daily life through home automation (called domotic) and assistive applications that are taking place in habitations, up to industrial and service employments. With this strict cooperation between humans and robots, it is of absolute necessity to assess the robotic systems' capabilities and performance to ensure safety and reliability according to actual and significant criteria and parameters. Within this context, there are delays in technology transfer from research frameworks toward actual applicative scenarios. These delays are caused by the lack of methodologies and standardized procedures for the experiment execution and result comparison. A further restraint to the needed process of technology transfer is due to the inability to understand the actual capabilities of the systems and to be aware and confident (or not) about what they can be realistically employed for. In many cases, this can also turn into the inability to define specific regulations for the employment of robotic platforms to comply with the current laws. This is the case for marine robotics. Tethered vehicles [e.g., remotely operated vehicles (ROVs)] are considered part of the vessel equipment when they are operated from a ship (because of the physical connection provided by the cable). Conversely, whenever autonomous systems, such as unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) or autonomous underwater vehicles are commanded through an acoustic or Wi-Fi/radio communication link, they are considered as navigating platforms and are subject to the regulation in force. For the commercial employment of these vehicles, it is then necessary to strongly assess the vehicle's capabilities in a standardized way, to guarantee the operating performance and evaluate limitations of the target system.},

abstract={Robotic weapons are widely believed to be the future of war. Dramatic progress in the science and engineering of robotics, alongside the perceived success of the US Predator and Reaper drones in Iraq and Afghanistan, has led many commentators to conclude that the wars of the twenty-first century increasingly will be fought, by industrialized nations at least, using remotely piloted and autonomous weapon systems (AWSs). This belief also is playing an important role in shaping the thinking and practice of militaries around the world, which are scrambling to purchase drones and to develop and deploy robots for both combat and combat-support roles. Thus, for instance, all the US armed services have published "roadmap" documents detailing ambitious plans to integrate unmanned systems (UMSs) into their forces. The new enthusiasm for robots in military and policy circles has led to philosophers and ethicists paying increased attention to issues surrounding the military uses of robots.},

abstract={As concern for water resource availability increases, so does the need for intelligent aquatic sensing applications. The requirements, and complexity of such applications has also increased due to demands for: 1) broad spatial coverage and high spatial resolution monitoring, 2) capability for resolving fine scale spatiotemporal dynamics and 3) the need for rapid system deployment with semi-autonomous operation. With these criteria in mind, we present the Aquatic Networked InfoMechanical System (NIMS-AQ). NIMS-AQ was developed based on experience gained from engineering research and collaboration with aquatic scientists and environmental engineers during several in-field measurement campaigns [1], [2], [3]. In this paper we demonstrate the effectiveness of NIMS- AQ through two experimental sensing campaigns encompassing both river and lake environments. Each campaign is centered around critical water resource monitoring objectives such as temperature, flow and contaminant levels. Experimental results for autonomous depth profiling using a submersible sonar system as well as adaptive sampling algorithms guided by phenomena models are presented herein. The found results conform with our objectives for rapid and systematic operation. Preliminary studies also indicate the systems viability for use with an autonomous iterative experiment design for environmental applications (A-IDEA) methodology that is currently under development. The IDEA methodology [1] provides effective characterization of spatiotemporal dynamics in aquatic environments. A-IDEA, as it is to be implemented on the NIMS-AQ platform, is also described.},

abstract={The Center for Robot-Assisted Search and Rescue has fielded two AEOS man-portable unmanned surface, a YSI Ecomapper and VideoRay underwater marine vehicle in the aftermath of Hurricanes Wilma (2005, Florida) and Ike (2008, Texas) for littoral structural inspection. By providing above and below waterline inspection of roads, bridges, seawalls, robots could cut the time involved in determining how to repair a bridge from on order of a month to a few days and could eliminate the need for divers to risk their lives trying to see and move around debris in cloudy, fast-moving currents. For example, using a DIDSON acoustic camera, healthy pilings were seen at Rollover Pass Bridge but scour was seen at the Marco Island bridge. The AEOS unmanned surface vehicle is a catamaran style design with a central T-shaped chassis that supports the electronics, instrumentation and control system. The footprint is 1.9m long and 1.2m wide with a minimum draft of 0.3m. The USV is engineered for autonomous and teleoperated control. The custom software allows for point and click waypoint inputs through a Google Earth style interface. All data and system information is georeferenced and databased. Besides illustrating the utility of unmanned marine vehicles for hurricane damage assessment, the field work identified many open research questions for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Fully autonomous control in USVs is hampered by the loss of GPS and inaccuracies near structures, such as going under bridges as well as rough seas and currents. Even with accurate GPS, the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) for super- and sub-structures is difficult. USVs suffer from the limitations of wireless communications, including intermittent loss and low bandwidth compared with the amount of video imagery being transmitted. Atmospheric effects such as fog and spray interfere with autonomous sensing and avoidance as well as teleoperation.},

This creates the need to develop a better understanding of the USAR procedures and specific requirements in order to guide the design of the robotics technology which will be accepted by USAR professionals. The current paper explores the specific requirements for the assistive technology, and extracts design guidelines for development of the robotic technology to be used during USAR operations. Design guidelines are derived from both literature review and from a qualitative study performed with Vancouver Heavy Urban Search and Rescue Task Force (HUSAR), focusing on usage scenarios and specific requirements for communication, control and user experience. The study revealed that the most crucial factors for the design of the robot are speed, robustness, reliability, weight, affordability, and adaptability to different environments and tasks, as well as ability to provide a two-way audio/video communication. For the interface, the most important characteristics are its learnability, immersiveness, and ability to afford a high sense of spatial presence. We further discuss how the above requirements were implemented though a case-study of the development of the ``TeleSpider'' (a hexapod tele-operated walking robot), and assess its effectiveness during the field testing at the Vancouver HUSAR warehouse. Failing to meet a number of the discussed requirements will likely result in the technology to be rejected by the USAR team, and never being used during actual deployments as has happened with a number of existing technologies.",

abstract={The primary goal of the Ocean Seismic Network Pilot Experiment (OSNPE) was to learn how to make high quality broadband seismic measurements on the ocean bottom in preparation for a permanent ocean seismic network. The experiment also had implications for the development of a capability for temporary (e.g., 1 year duration) seismic experiments on the ocean floor. Equipment for installing, operating and monitoring borehole observatories in the deep sea was also tested including a lead-in package, a logging probe, a wire line packer and a control vehicle. The control vehicle was used in three modes during the experiment: for observation of seafloor features and equipment, for equipment launch and recovery, and for power supply and telemetry between ocean bottom units and the ship. The OSNPE which was completed in June 1998 acquired almost four months of continuous data and it demonstrated clearly that a combination of shallow buried and borehole broadband sensors could provide comparable quality data to broadband seismic installations on islands and continents. Burial in soft mud appears to be adequate at frequencies below the microseism peak. Although the borehole sensor was subject to installation noise at low frequencies (0.6 to 50 mHz), analysis of the OSNPE data provides new insights into our understanding of ocean bottom ambient noise. The OSNPE results clearly demonstrate the importance of sediment borne shear modes in ocean bottom ambient noise behavior. Ambient noise drops significantly at high frequencies for a sensor placed just at the sediment basalt interface. At frequencies above the microseism peak, there are two reasons that ocean bottom stations have been generally regarded as noisier than island or land stations: ocean bottom stations are closer to the noise source (the surface gravity waves) and most ocean bottom stations to date have been installed on low rigidity sediments where they are subject to the effects of shear wave resonances. When sensors are placed in boreholes in basement the performance of ocean bottom seismic stations approaches that of continental and island stations. A broadband borehole seismic station should be included in any real-time ocean bottom observatory.},

abstract ={This article proposes a new collision avoidance decision method for ships, allowing ships at risk of collision to take timely collision avoidance measures to ensure safe passage. Through vessel traffic service (VTS) collision alert system, an analysis can be made for the probability of a ship collision and an early warning can be issued. For ships in potential collision danger, the proposed method will use Microsoft Visual Studio to establish a knowledge base of international regulations for preventing collisions at sea. Thus, based on an analysis of the situation when encountering other ships, the knowledge base will suggest an appropriate avoidance technique and use a fuzzy monitoring system, propose a novel collision danger domain that forbids entering forgive-way ship. Considering the required advance for ship turning, the fuzzy monitoring system will suggest the optimal rudder steering procedure for the give-way ship, allow the ship to avoid collision and ensure navigation safety. The avoidance action taken by the ship does not consider reducing speed, instead focuses only on rudder steering. The system also integrates VTS/automatic identification system (AIS)/marine geographic information system (MGIS) by using MGIS as an AIS imaging system to facilitate the optimal decision for ship collision avoidance and determine the input linguistic variables for the fuzzy logic theory via an analytical hierarchy process. The proposed method can enhance the VTS operator's decision-making abilities for collision avoidance by providing a fuzzy monitoring system.},

pages={42-53}, 
abstract={Lagrangian drifters are oceanographic devices used to study circulation patterns in the ocean. The devices are typically passive, which means that they have no actuators to initiate motion. They are mainly driven by the ocean currents. A drifter, as depicted in Figure 1, in principle, consists of a surface float and a drogue connected via a tether. The surface float provides the necessary buoyancy to hold the drogue at a certain depth, whereas the drogue (and, thus, the whole drifter) is carried by the currents prevailing at that depth of the ocean. A main focus of oceanographers' and marine biologists' research is the complex dynamics of the ocean, the circulation patterns of water, and the induced movements of effluents, larvae, and other microorganisms [1]. Drifters are used to tag and track the ocean currents and can help to better explain both oceanographic as well as biological phenomena. Our particular interest is the monitoring task of tracking wastewater plumes in the coastal ocean. In this article, we describe the design of low-power, low-cost Lagrangian drifters for ocean monitoring, developed at the Robotic Embedded Systems Laboratory (RESL) at the University of Southern California (USC). We discuss the design challenges and present the overall system characteristics of the RESL drifters. The drifters are augmented by radio communication, which simplifies the task of drifter recovery by a research vessel and enables setting up a bidirectional wireless sensor network between drifters, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), vessels, and base stations.},

However, our ability to image the mantle is severely hampered by a lack of seismic data collected in marine areas. Here we report observations made under different noise conditions (in the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian and Pacific Oceans) by a submarine floating seismograph, and show that such floats are able to fill the oceanic data gap. Depending on the ambient noise level, the floats can record between 35 and 63% of distant earthquakes with a moment magnitude MZ6.5. Even magnitudes o6.0 can be successfully observed under favourable noise conditions. The serendipitous recording of an earthquake swarm near the Indian Ocean triple junction enabled us to establish a threshold magnitude between 2.7 and 3.4 for local earthquakes in the noisiest of the three environments.},

However, human eyes are sometimes inadequate owing to a long flight and wide views. In order to carry out the prompt rescue of human life, development of the searching system in place of the human eyes is surely required. This paper deals with a new search method for detection of the rescue target using image processing techniques. To detect the small target in the wide views over the sea, we have proposed a new method including the image processing techniques based on the color information and the composite image sensor which increases about the measurement accuracy and the image processing speed at actual field. At the first step of the study, we attempt to extract the image data of the rescue target with the orange color in an experimental sea.<<ETX>>},

pages={1-6}, 
abstract={Seafloor investigations with unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) have been carried out in various situations. It is expected in future that seafloor investigations of sea area where manned support vessels cannot enter will be accomplished with UUVs. For searches after an accident and a disaster, detected objects should be immediately identified. In such situation, it is convenient to have a system, that transfers UUV status data and/or observation data from an UUV to a distant base in real time. Therefore, we have developed the Underwater Real-time Communication System (URCS) where unmanned surface vehicle (USV) relays UUV status and Sonar images to a distant base in real-time. The USV communicates with the UUV by two sets of acoustic device and with the distant support vessel by satellite communication. For the USV to receive image data from UUV it is necessary to keep USV just above the UUV, because high-speed acoustic device used for image data transmission has strong directivity in general. Therefore, we have developed Parallel Cruising Technology by using Cooperative Control (PaCTeCC) method. A sea trial of real-time data transmission of sonar images from the cruising UUV to the distant support vessel via the USV was conducted in July 2014. In this paper, we report the details of PaCTeCC method and the experiment results.},

abstract={Safe and efficient following of a time varying motion goal by an autonomous unmanned surface vehicle (USV) in a sea environment with obstacles is a challenge. The vehicle’s tracking capability is inherently influenced by its dynamics, the motion characteristics of the motion goal, as well as by the configuration of obstacles in the marine environment. We have developed an approach that utilizes a lattice-based trajectory planning to generate a dynamically feasible, resolution optimal, collision-free trajectory to allow the vehicle to reliably reach the motion goal. We utilized a trajectory following controller to achieve high tracking efficiency while still preserving motion safety. The entire approach is based on the developed USV system architecture that encapsulates the necessary trajectory planning components. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the developed planner in a simulated environment with static obstacles. In addition, we have developed a physical evaluation setup.},

abstract="The capability of following a moving target in an environment with obstacles is required as a basic and necessary function for realizing an autonomous unmanned surface vehicle (USV). Many target following scenarios involve a follower and target vehicles that may have different maneuvering capabilities. Moreover, the follower vehicle may not have prior information about the intended motion of the target boat. This paper presents a trajectory planning and tracking approach for following a differentially constrained target vehicle operating in an obstacle field. The developed approach includes a novel algorithm for computing a desired pose and surge speed in the vicinity of the target boat, jointly defined as a motion goal, and tightly integrates it with trajectory planning and tracking components of the entire system. The trajectory planner generates a dynamically feasible, collision-free trajectory to allow the USV to safely reach the computed motion goal. Trajectory planning needs to be sufficiently fast and yet produce dynamically feasible and short trajectories due to the moving target. This required speeding up the planning by searching for trajectories through a hybrid, pose-position state space using a multi-resolution control action set. The search in the velocity space is decoupled from the search for a trajectory in the pose space. Therefore, the underlying trajectory tracking controller computes desired surge speed for each segment of the trajectory and ensures that the USV maintains it. We have carried out simulation as well as experimental studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed approach.",

abstract="Turbidity currents, and other types of underwater sediment density flow, are arguably the most important flow process for moving sediment across our planet. Direct monitoring provides the most reliable information on the varied ways in which these flows are triggered, and thus forms the basis for this contribution. Recent advances in flow monitoring make this contribution timely, although monitoring is biased towards more frequent flow types. Submarine deltas fed by bedload dominated rivers can be very active with tens of events each year. Larger events are generated by delta-lip failures, whilst smaller events can be associated with motion of up-slope migrating bedforms. River-fed submarine canyons are flushed every few years by powerful long run-out flows. Flows in river-fed delta and canyon systems tend to occur during months of elevated river discharge. However, many flows do not coincide with flood peaks, or occur where rivers do not reach hyperpycnal concentrations, and are most likely triggered by failure of rapidly deposited sediment. Plunging of hyperpycnal river floodwater commonly triggers dilute and slow moving flows in lakes and reservoirs, and has been shown to produce mm-thick fine-grained deposits. It is proposed here that such thin and fine deposits are typical of flows triggered by hyperpycnal river floods, rather than thicker sand layers with traction structure or displaying inverse-to-normal grading. Oceanographic canyons are detached from river mouths and fed by oceanographic processes (wave and tide resuspension, longshore drift, etc.). Most events in these canyons are associated with large wave heights. Up-slope migrating crescentic bedforms are seen, similar to those observed in river-fed deltas. Oceanographic processes tend to infill canyons, which are flushed episodically by much more powerful flows, inferred to result from slope failure. This filling and flushing model is less applicable to river-fed canyons in which flushing events are much more frequent. Oceanographic canyons may result from rapid sea level rise that detaches river mouths from canyon heads, and they can remain active during sea level highstands. Deep-water basin plains are often dominated by infrequent but very large flows triggered by failure of the continental slope. Recurrence intervals of these flows appear almost random, and only weakly (if at all) correlated with sea level change. Turbidites can potentially provide a valuable long-term record of major earthquakes, but widespread slope failure is the only reliable criteria for inferring seismic triggering. However, not all major earthquakes trigger widespread slope failure, so that the record is incomplete in some locations."

abstract="Efficient maritime navigation through dynamic obstructions at close range is still a serious issue faced by mariners. There have been studies focusing on collision risk assessment in the past, but the majority were based on the first person perspective, with area-based ship domain concepts that are defined around either the ownship or the obstacle. Such methods are acceptable for encounters where the ownship is required to manoeuvre according to the collision regulations (COLREGs), but they will not work correctly if the ownship is the stay-on party. This article presents an alternative method of assessing the collision risk for surface ships in close-range encounters that is compliant with the COLREGs as well as other ships from different perspectives.",

abstract = {Abstract The deployment of a fleet of autonomous marine vehicles (AMVs) allows for the parallelisation of missions, intervehicle support for longer deployment times, adaptability and redundancy to in situ mission changes, and effective use of the right vehicle for the right purpose. End users and operators of AMVs face challenges in planning complex missions due to the limitations of their vehicles, dynamic, operationally constrictive, and unstructured environments, and in minimising risks to equipment, the mission, and personnel. Automated mission planning for AMV fleets can be a tool to reduce the complexity of programming vehicle tasking, and to perform validity assessments for end user-specified goals, allowing the operator to focus on risk assessment. We present a critical review of the current advances in automated planning for AMV fleets, investigating the limitations of available state-of-the-art tools and providing a road map of the goals and challenges based on analysis of field reports and end user initiatives.},

abstract={The subduction rate of an oceanic plate may accelerate after large earthquakes rupture the interplate coupling between the oceanic and overriding continental plates. To better understand postseismic deformation processes in an incoming oceanic plate, we directly measured the displacement rate of the Pacific Plate near the Japan Trench after the 2011 Tohoku-Oki earthquake using a GPS/acoustic technique over a period of 2 years (September 2012 to September 2014). The displacement rate was measured to be 18.0 ± 4.5 cm yr−1 (N302.0°E) relative to the North American Plate, which is almost twice as fast as the predicted interseismic plate motion. Because the sum of steady plate motion and viscoelastic response to the Tohoku-Oki earthquake roughly accounts for the observed displacement rate, we conclude that viscoelastic relaxation is the primary mechanism responsible for postseismic deformation of the Pacific Plate and that significant subduction acceleration did not occur at least not during the observation period.},

abstract={ Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate two models for adjusting autonomy in mobile robots to find out the best way for the operator to interact with the system with as many robots as possible. The first model is the most used in mobile robots; the second proposes a flexible autonomy management.Background: There are different ways of adjusting the autonomy level in man-machine systems: adjustable autonomy, in which the operator has the initiative over the autonomy level; adaptive autonomy, in which the autonomy level is adjusted depending on the task and context; and mixed initiatives. One of the drawbacks of using adjustable autonomy is that it is claimed not to be flexible enough, resulting in a high operator workload. We propose and evaluate a flexible adjustable autonomy model for robot-team supervision.Method: Two experiments were designed to test the scalability and performance of the man-machine system with two alternative configurations for the autonomy management. The independent variable is the number of robots, and the measured variable is the man-machine system performance. The experiments are between subjects. We have used ANOVA and Bonferroni post hoc analysis for analyzing the results.Results: On the basis of these analyses, we conclude that a flexible adjustable autonomy model results in better performance than the classic, rigid one, in which the operator directly chooses the autonomy level.Conclusion: Flexible autonomy adjustment permits one operator to control a team of robots with better results in terms of performance and robot use, as he or she can directly act at the error level, leaving the responsibility of readjusting and resuming the task to the system and hence reducing the operator’s workload.Application: The results can be applied to exploration robotics, mainly, in which one operator controls a team of robots. In general, these principles can be extended to other single-man/multiple-machine systems. }

However, it has the capabilities of a global purpose manoeuvring simulator, including state of the art models of manoeuvrability, sea-keeping and sea surface simulations, which are integrated into the system. Additionally to common real-time physically based manoeuvrability simulators, this simulator also includes real-time ship motions calculations. The system architecture is composed of three main modules that support interaction and real-time data exchange with the integrated mathematical models. The manoeuvrability module allows the user to control the steering gear, the main engine and the bow thrusters, through the Virtual Environment. The seakeeping module computes wave induced ship motions in real-time according to ship's position, heading and speed, based on pre-calculated response amplitude operators. The sea surface module generates and simulates sea states defined by wave spectra. The system takes advantage of the programmable capabilities of the graphics processor units to increase the performance and realism of the simulations. The simulator may be used by operation planners and ship masters, as a tool for testing and training different offloading scenarios and approaching manoeuvres."

There is an urging need for a tool which would help environmental response teams to perform rapid understanding of the location and the extent of the spill, to effectively establish an appropriate response. This paper presents a cooperative robotic system for environmental monitoring consisting of an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) and an Autonomous Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV). The main contributions of the paper are: systematic description of the design and implementation of the proposed cooperative robotic system, novel human-on-the-loop (HOTL) approach applied on the system for environmental monitoring and demonstration of the results of the open-sea experiments on pollution deliberately caused by harmless Rhodamine WT, carried out in Cartagena, Spain in June 2015. The proposed HOTL system provides near real-time pollution measurement data, while not consuming a significant amount of human time and effort. It supports decision-making and allows the operator to initiate the most adequate mission in a current situation, i.e., ensures mission change on-the-fly. While the AUV samples the ocean, the USV maintains the localization and communication data transfer to the control centre and corrects the AUV’s dead reckoning error.},

Subsequently, the application of three major classes of fuzzy logic control, including the conventional fuzzy control (Mamdani fuzzy control and Takagi--Sugeno--Kang fuzzy control), adaptive fuzzy control (self-tuning fuzzy control and direct/indirect adaptive fuzzy control), and hybrid fuzzy control (fuzzy PID control, fuzzy sliding mode control, and neuro-fuzzy control) are presented. In particular, we summarize the design and analysis process of direct/indirect adaptive fuzzy control and fuzzy PID control in marine robotic fields.

abstract="In this paper, we present ℒ1 adaptive control theory to provide stabilization of the sailing yachts around any desired heading angle. The nonlinear heading model of the sailing yachts, which is presented in a recent paper, is expressed as a linear time-invariant system, i.e. the first-order Nomoto model, for which an ℒ1 adaptive heading controller is designed. A conventional PID heading controller is also constructed by pole-placement for the yacht system, and the previously presented backstepping controller is redesigned by adding an integral action. Afterwards, the performance achieved with the ℒ1 controller is compared with that obtained via the backstepping controller and the PID benchmark controller. Simulation results show that the ℒ1 heading controller ensures stable tracking and guarantees robustness. Furthermore, the performance of the ℒ1 surpasses that of the rest two controllers in terms of robustness when considering the unknown plant parameters, and energy saving is achieved by less rudder deflections in comparison to PID control."

abstract={This research teams an Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to augment and automate marine mass casualty incident search and rescue in emergency response phase. The demand for real-time responsiveness of those missions requires fast and comprehensive situational awareness and precise operations, which are challenging to achieve because of the large area and the flat nature of the water field. The responders, drowning victims, and rescue vehicle are far apart and all located at the sea level. The long distances mean responders cannot clearly discern the rescue vehicle and victims from the surrounding water. Furthermore, being at the same elevation makes depth perception difficult. Rescue vehicle and victims at different distances from the responder will always appear to be close together. This makes it almost impossible for the responders to accurately drive the USV to the victims in time. This paper proposes the use of a UAV to compensate for the lack of elevation of the responders and to automate search and rescue operations. The benefit of this system is two fold: 1) the UAV provides responders with an overhead view of the field, covers larger area than direct visual, and allows more accurate perception of the situation, and 2) it automates the rescue process so that the responders can focus on task-level needs instead of tediously driving the USV to the victims. Thirty autonomous navigation trials in 4 rescue scenarios prove the first known successful implementation of a small UAV visually navigating a USV.},

abstract={ A wind-driven land-yacht robot which will be applied in polar expedition is presented in this article. As the main power of robot is provided by wing sail, improving the efficiency of wing sail is the key for its motion. Wing sail is composed of airfoil, so airfoil theory is researched first, and then several airfoils and their aerodynamic performance are compared, and a high-efficiency airfoil is selected. After that, overturning torque and start wind speed of robot are analyzed to determine the size of the wing sail. At last, the wing sail is manufactured and checked, and it is tested by start wind speed experiments, running speed experiments, steering motion, and obstacle avoidance experiments. The minimum start wind speed is 6 m/s. When wind speed is 10.3 m/s and angle of attack is 90°, running velocity of robot is 1.285 m/s. A land-yacht robot can run steering motion well and avoid obstacle to the target. The result shows that wing sail satisfies the motion requirement of land-yacht robot. }

abstract={Although there exist some unmanned surface platforms, and parts of them have been applied in flooding disaster relief, the autonomy of these platforms is still so weak that most of them can only work under the control of operators. The primary reason is the difficulty of obtaining a dynamical model that is sufficient rich for model-based control and sufficient simple for model parameters identification. This makes them difficult to be used to achieve some high-performance autonomous control, such as robust control with respect to disturbances and unknown dynamics and trajectory tracking control in complicated and dynamical surroundings. In this chapter, a flooding disaster-oriented unmanned surface vehicle (USV) designed and implemented by Shenyang Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SIA, CAS) is introduced first, including the hardware and software structures. Then, we propose a quasi-linear parameter varying (qLPV) model to approach the dynamics of the USV system. We first apply this to solve a structured modeling problem and then introduce model error to solve an unstructured modeling problem. Subsequently, the qLPV model identification results are analyzed and the superiority compared to two linear models is demonstrated. At last, extensive application experiments, including rescuing rope throwing using an automatic pneumatic and water sampling in a 2.5 m radius circle, are described in detail to show the performance of course keeping control and GPS point tracking control based on the proposed model.},

USVs have the potential, and in some cases the demonstrated ability, to reduce risk to manned forces, provide the necessary force multiplication to accomplish military missions, perform tasks which manned vehicles cannot, and do so in a way that is affordable for the navy. A survey of USV activities worldwide as well as the general technical challenges of USVs was presented below. A general description of USVs was provided along with their typical applications. The technical challenges of developing a USV include its intelligence level, control, high stability, and developmental cost reduction. Through the joint efforts of researchers around the world, it is believed that the development of USVs will enter a new phase in the near future, as USVs could soon be applied widely both in military and civilian service.",

abstract={Because of extreme weather and frequent natural disasters, improvement of disaster prevention capabilities and early warning technologies is an urgent matter. Inshore areas are where ocean and land intersect; the sea conditions and environment are complex and changeable, and human activities are frequent in these areas. Natural disasters, such as a substantial rise in sea levels, coastal erosion and transitions, and rapid flooding from tsunamis, and human development projects, pollution, and ecological damage must be thoroughly investigated, monitored, recorded, and prevented. The west coast of Taiwan, particularly the southeast coastal plain, is a highly populated narrow area; thus, field survey tools with a high degree of freedom and flexible applications are required for data collection to reach its full potential. The Taiwan Ocean Research Institute developed an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) for the “Long Term Observation for Research Performed in TORI” 2010 project. This USV is a platform that integrates scientific equipment, including Wi-Fi communication and a satellite-based global positioning system (GPS) with navigation images and signals, to form an internal network with onshore control bases to allow the instant acquisition of measured data and enable researchers to conduct surveys in safe conditions. USVs are appropriate for various types of inshore research and surveys, such as marine topography, sediment disposition analysis, inshore engineering measurements, and the monitoring of hydrology, water quality, and the environment. One aim of the Taiwan Ocean Research Institute (TORI) is to establish a method to use the USV for collecting inshore marine topography, hydrology, water quality, and meteorological data. Integrating field investigations of Taiwan’s coastal waters will provide data for verifying numerical simulations and lead scientists to explore novel and unknown areas.},

To overcome this problem, a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based inspection system is developed to detect cracks on the lateral sides and underside of bridges. Applying obstacle avoidance modules, UAV can reach bridges' lateral sides and underside within a safe distance. Thus the onboard camera can capture images of bridge surface in a high resolution. To locate the positions of cracks and solve the problem of limited horizon of single image, a fast feature-based stitching algorithm is developed. Then an edge detection method using structured forests is utilized to detect cracks on the large panorama. With image distortion corrected, the positions of cracks can be located on the large panorama. Experimental results validate the applicability and efficiency of the proposed UAV-based crack inspection system.},

abstract={ To efficiently remove and recycle oil spills, we construct aligned ZnO nanorod arrays on the surface of the porous stainless steel wire mesh to fabricate a porous unmanned ship (PUS) with properties of superhydrophobicity, superoleophilicity, and low drag by imitating the structure of nonwetting leg of water strider. The superhydrophobicity of the PUS is stable, which can support 16.5 cm water column with pore size of 100 μm. Water droplet can rebound without adhesion. In the process of oil/water separation, when the PUS contacts with oil, the oil is quickly pulled toward and penetrates into the PUS automatically. The superhydrophobicity and low water adhesion force of the PUS surface endow the PUS with high oil recovery capacity (above 94\%) and drag-reducing property (31\% at flowing velocity of 0.38m/s). In addition, the PUS has good corrosion resistance and reusability. We further investigate the wetting behavior of water and oil, oil recovery capacity, drag-reducing property, and corrosion resistance of the PUS after oil absorbed. The PUS surface changes significantly from superhydrophobic to hydrophobic after absorbing oil. However, the oil absorbed PUS possesses better drag-reducing property and corrosion resistance due to the changes of the motion state of the water droplets. }

abstract={When searching for small targets at sea based on an infrared imaging system, irregular and random vibration of the airborne imaging platform causes intense interference for the pipeline-filtering, which is an algorithm that performs well in detecting small targets but is particularly sensitive to interframe vibrations of sequence images. This paper puts forward a pipeline-filtering algorithm that has a good performance on self-adaptive antivibration. In the block matching method that combines the normalized cross-correlations coefficient with the normalized mutual information, the interframe vibration of sequence images is acquired in real time and used to correct coordinates of the single-frame detection results, and then the corrected detection results are used to complete the pipeline-filtering. In addition, under severe sea conditions, small targets at sea may disappear transiently, leading to missing detection. This algorithm is also able to resolve this problem. Experimental results show that the algorithm can overcome the problem of interframe vibration of sequence images, thus realizing accurate detection of small maritime targets.},

abstract={Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to present a design of climbing robot with magnetic wheels which can move on the surface of steel bridge. The locomotion concept is based on adapted lightweight magnetic wheel units with relatively high attractive force and friction force.
Design/methodology/approach
The robot has the main advantages of being compact (352 × – 215 × – 155 mm), lightweight (2.3 kg without battery) and simple mechanical structure. It is not only able to climb vertical walls and follow circumferential paths, but also able to pass complex obstacles such as bolts, steps, convex and concave corners with almost any inclination regarding gravity. By using a servo as a compliant joint, the wheel base can be changed to enable the robot to overcome convex corners.
Findings
The experiment results show that the climbing robot has a good performance on locomotion, and it is successful in negotiating the complex obstacles. On the other hand, the limitations in locomotion of the robot are also presented.
Originality/value
Compared with the past researches, the robot shows good performance on overcoming complex obstacles such as concave corners, convex corners, bolts and steps on the steel bridge. Magnetic wheel with the characterization of compact size and lightweight is able to provide bigger adhesion force and friction coefficient.},

abstract={The Wave Glider, a wave-powered unmanned maritime vehicle (UMV), represents a novel and unique approach to persistent ocean presence. Wave Gliders harvest the abundant energy contained in ocean waves to provide essentially limitless propulsion. The Wave Glider can operate as a vessel, covering long distances in the ocean, or as a station-keeping platform. Wave Gliders have demonstrated long open-ocean transits and extended deployments of up to one year. The High-frequency Acoustic Recording Package (HARP) is an autonomous data logging system optimized for long-term, broad-band marine mammal monitoring. The HARP system includes low-power electronics, high-speed data sampling, large capacity data storage, and batteries for self-contained power. In addition to housing the data logger, a hydrophone was designed to be towed behind the Wave Glider. Together, Scripps Institution of Oceanography and Liquid Robotics combined these two technologies to demonstrate a new approach to marine mammal monitoring. Providing a mobile, long-endurance and fully connected platform for acoustic monitoring, the Wave Glider with HARP enables new scientific results and improved economics. Over a series of engineering and scientific evaluations, the HARP system has proven effective for monitoring marine mammals when deployed on the Wave Glider. In this paper, we give an overview of the Wave Glider platform and integrated HARP system, and present results from the extensive engineering sea trials conducted with several prototype and production versions of the vehicle and data logger.},

The Challenge 1 USV is a Lutra 1.1 autonomous airboat modified to carry an UltraRadiacTM. The debris-free area to survey is determined by teleoperation, then the system autonomously generates and executes a novel spiral path and sampling policy. Challenge 1 was tested for proof-of-concept at Texas A\&M Engineering Extension Service's Disaster City with a cesium-137 source placed near one shore of a pond 72 meters from the deployment point. During this test, 775 radiation readings were taken over an area of 57.61 square meters in 18 minutes. These data were used by an inverse distance weighting interpolation algorithm to produce a visual heatmap.},

The current state of USV interface design centers on 1) ergonomic handheld devices, such as a Futaba, for teleoperation missions, or 2) non-ergonomic laptops with Mission Planner (MP) style of interfaces or teleoperation and autonomous missions. Pure, teleoperated USVs do not offer the operator needed information in terms of robot health or status. USVs with autonomous capabilities controlled and monitored via MP are not first responder friendly. Important artifacts as to the status of the vehicle are not always easily accessible. This work is a simplified, easy to use interface into the USV. This new interface combines the key artifacts in a user-friendly, tablet-based application, as well as facilitates the operator with the control and operation of the USV. This approach will first strengthen responder's trust in USVs. Second, this interface will facilitate responders during a rescue mission by simplifying the USVs control which will allow the responder to focus his or her attention to more pertinent tasks. A strengthened since of trust by first responders in using USVs will facilitate in the victim to lifeguard ratio that currently plagues responders today. The initial prototype and second version of the interface were critiqued by the Castrium Rescue Brigade and LACoFD Baywatch. The final version incorporated all feedback attained and was tested at the DHS CAUSE V Exercise in Bellingham, WA.},

  abstract="An unmanned merchant vessel seems to be escaping from the stage of idea exploration. Once the concept proofs its safety, it may become a part of maritime reality. Although the safety aspect of such a ship has been addressed by a handful of scholars, the problem remains open. This is mainly due to lack of knowledge regarding actual operational circumstances and design of unmanned ships, which are yet to be developed. In the attempt of bridging this gap, the risk analysis associated with unmanned ships needs to be carried out, where all relevant hazards and consequences are assessed and quantified in systematic manner. In this paper we present the results of a first step of such analysis, namely the hazard analysis associated with the unmanned ships. The list of hazards covers various aspects of unmanned shipping originating from both design and operational phases of vessel’s life. Subsequently the hazards and related consequences are organized in a casual manner, resulting in the development of a structure of a risk model.",

abstract={ Purpose Autonomous obstacle avoidance is important in unmanned surface vehicle (USV) navigation. Although the result of obstacle detection is often inaccurate because of the inherent errors of LIDAR, conventional methods typically emphasize on a single obstacle-avoidance algorithm and neglect the limitation of sensors and safety in a local region. Conventional methods also fail in seamlessly integrating local and global obstacle avoidance algorithms. This paper aims to present a cooperative manoeuvring approach including both local and global obstacle avoidance. Design/methodology/approach The global algorithm used in our USV is the Artificial Potential Field-Ant Colony Optimization (APF-ACO) obstacle-avoidance algorithm, which plans a relative optimal path on the specified electronic map before the cruise of USV. The local algorithm is a multi-layer obstacle-avoidance framework based on a single LIDAR to present an efficient solution to USV path planning in the case of sensor errors and collision risks. When obstacles are within a layer, the USV uses a corresponding obstacle-avoidance algorithm. Then the USV moves towards the global direction according to fuzzy rules in the fuzzy layer. Findings The presented method offers a solution for obstacle avoidance in a complex environment. The USV follows the global trajectory planed by the APF-ACO algorithm. While, the USV can bypass current obstacle in the local region based on the multi-layer method effectively. This fact was validated by simulations and field trials. Originality/value The method presented in this paper takes advantage of algorithm integration that remedies errors of obstacle detection. Simulation and experiments were also conducted for performance evaluation. }

For more than twenty years, the Texas coast has relied on the Texas Automated Buoy System (TABS) for real-time surface current measurements. In early 2016, the installation of a network of high-frequency coastal ocean radars was implemented to supplement the in situ observations of the TABS system with terrestrial-based remote sensing observations of surface currents. The first set of paired systems, located at Rollover Pass and Surfside Beach, Texas, are providing data hourly in near-real time. A comparison between the time series for the radar and buoys was made in order to determine the correlation coefficient between these signals; correlation coefficients above 0.5 were found for the three buoy locations included in this research, for both, the meridional and zonal component. This project represents the integration of the Texas coast into the high-frequency radar national network, and constitutes the first stage of a three methods comparison, which will include the data of the high frequency radar, an Autonomous Surface Vehicle and TABS.},

abstract = "Spawned by fast paced progress in marine science and technology, the past two decades have witnessed growing interest in ocean exploration and exploitation for scientific and commercial purposes, the development of technological products for the maritime and offshore industries, and a host of other activities in which the marine environment takes center stage. In this context, marine robotics has steadily emerged as a key enabling technology for the execution of increasingly complex and challenging missions at sea. Intensive research and development in this field have led to major advances and shown unequivocally the effectiveness and reliability of marine robotics solutions in several domains. This progress goes hand in hand with the availability of increasingly sophisticated acoustic networks for multiple, cooperative missions involving surface and underwater robots. At the root of this trend is the fruitful dialogue between robotic systems developers and end-users with the capacity to convert general mission objectives into functional and technical specifications that serve as application-driven requirements for engineering development. The result is the tremendous progress observed in the consolidated methodologies and procedures adopted and the consequent impact on science, industry, and the society at large. In spite of the progress in the area, however many challenges must still be faced and novel applications will continue to set further requirements for future generations of marine robots and their enabling systems. The time is therefore appropriate to overview recent trends in the field of marine robotics and assess their impact on several important application domains. With these objectives in mind, in the present paper we highlight key technological achievements in the field, analyze some of the shortcomings encountered, and indicate specific issues that warrant further research and development effort. To this end, we review a number of highly representative projects in the field, with due account for the theoretical frameworks upon which technological developments build upon. Finally, the paper concludes with an outlook on the future of marine robotics, both from a theoretical and practical standpoint, and describes recently initiated projects that hold promise for the development of advanced tools and systems for ocean exploration and exploitation."

Unmanned system is one of the solution that replace people in the rescue operation. However, there are still some obvious defects of unmanned system that are difficult to overcome, such as the limited perspective of the Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) and the short flight endurance of a micro multi-rotor craft also called little Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). At the same time, they both have other advantages that the other one does not have, for instance, the long cruising ability of the USV and the broad horizons of the UAV. Thus in this paper we try to combine the superiorities of the USV and the UAV to make up for their defects, as a result, the whole system will be able to own a broad vision and a long cruising power.},

abstract={Gliding robotic fish, which is a hybrid of underwater gliders and robotic fish, is energy efficient and highly maneuverable and holds strong promise for long-duration monitoring of underwater environments. In this paper, a novel scheme is proposed for autonomously sampling multiple water columns using gliding robotic fish. The scheme exploits energy-efficient spiral-down motion to sample each water column, followed by sagittal-plane glide-up toward the direction of the next water column. Once surfacing, the robot uses Global Positioning System guidance to reach the next column location through swimming. To enhance the path-tracking performance, a two-degree-of-freedom controller involving H∞ control is used in the spiral motion, and a sliding-mode controller is employed to regulate the yaw angle during glide-up. The sampling scheme has been implemented on a gliding robotic fish prototype, “Grace,” and verified first in pool experiments and then in field experiments involving the sampling of harmful algae concentration in the Wintergreen Lake, Michigan.},

abstract="The rapid development of autonomous systems and Information and Communications Technologies (ICT) create new opportunities for maritime activities. Existing autonomous systems are becoming more powerful and utilise the capabilities of several types of devices such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) -- sometimes referred as Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) --, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), moored and drifting systems and, recently emerging, autonomous vessels. Their importance in providing new services in maritime environments is undeniable and the opportunity for coordinated and interconnected operations is clear. However, continuous wide integration of various technologies in maritime environments still faces many challenges. Operations may take place in remote locations, so that dependence on third-party infrastructures such as satellite communication or terrestrial communication systems must be expected. The reliability, performance, availability, and cost of such systems are important issues that need to be tackled. This work reviews the major advancements on state-of-the-art autonomous maritime vehicles and systems, which are used in several different scenarios, from scientific research to transportation. Moreover, the paper highlights how available technologies can be composed in order to efficiently and effectively operate in maritime environments. Highlights of the trade-off between autonomy and communication requirements are provided and followed by an overview of promising communication and networking technologies that could encourage the integration of autonomous systems in maritime scenarios.",

The concern augments in the case of ships carrying cargo harmful to the environment and the passenger ships carrying thousands of lives. Accidental limit state analysis provides a basic methodology for the assessment of the grounding behaviour of a ship. The application of the method requires the definition of grounding scenarios and the associated probability of occurrence. The article presents the determination of probability of occurrence of grounding, which is based on a database of accidents involving Greek ships from 1992 to 2005. Parameters influencing the occurrence of groundings are identified and investigated using statistical significant tests.}

The Exxon Corporation, obviously responsible for the spill, focused on restoration, whereas the Trustees, a coalition of state and federal entities, focused on damage and its assessment. Despite billions of dollars expended, little new understanding was gained about the recovery dynamics of a high latitude marine ecosystem subject to an anthropogenic pulse perturbation. We discuss a variety of case studies that highlight the limitations to and shortcomings of the research effort. Given that more spills are inevitable, we recommend that future studies address spatial patterns in the intertidal, and focus on the abundances of long-lived species and on organisms that preserve a chronological record of growth. Oil spills, while tragic, represent opportunities to gain insight into the dynamics of marine ecosystems and should not be wasted. }

Sediment TPH, PAHs, and all classes peaked near Pensacola, Florida, and Galveston, Texas. Seawater TPH peaked off Pensacola; all of the above classes peaked off the Mississippi River, Louisiana and Galveston. Biota TPH and PAHs peaked near the Mississippi River; C-3 napthalenes peaked near the spill site. Seafood TPH peaked near the spill site, with PAHs and all classes peaking near Pensacola. We recommend that oil concentrations continued to be monitored in these media well after the spill has ceased to assist in defining re-opening dates for fisheries; closures should be maintained until hydrocarbon levels are deemed within appropriate limits."

  abstract={A class of path following and formation controllers are implemented on marine robots performing autonomous surveys in regions polluted by crude oil during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The controllers enable the robots to follow lines and curves, and maintain formation collectively while measuring reminiscent crude oil along their paths. The controllers are mathematically sound with proven convergence and robustness. However, their performance in the surveying missions is affected by natural disturbances caused by wind and water currents, and constraints such as sensor inaccuracy, localization errors, and network delays. This paper evaluates the performance of our controllers based on data collected during a survey performed at Grand Isle, Louisiana. These results will provide guidance for mission designs and inspire the future developments of our marine robots used to perform autonomous environmental surveys.}

  abstract={The tragic Deepwater Horizon accident in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 as well as the increase in deepwater offshore activity have increased public interest in counter-measures available for sub-surface releases of hydrocarbons. To arrive at proper contingency planning, response managers urge for a system for instant detection and characterization of accidental releases. Along these lines, this paper describes the application of a heterogeneous robotic system of unmanned vehicles: autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), unmanned surface vehicle (USV) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) extended with the oil spill numerical modeling, visualisation and decision support capabilities. A first set of field experiments simulating oil spill scenarios with Rhodamine WT was held in Croatia during the early autumn 2014. The objectives of this experiment were to test: effectiveness of the system for underwater detection of hydrocarbons, including multi-vehicle collaborative navigation and communication as well as visualisation of the system components.}

  abstract={Reducing the risk of oil spill disasters is essential for protecting the environmentand reducing economic losses. Oil spill surveillance constitutes an important component ofoil spill disaster management. Advances in remote sensing technologies can help to identifyparties potentially responsible for pollution and to identify minor spills before they causewidespread damage. Due to the large number of sensors currently available for oil spillsurveillance, there is a need for a comprehensive overview and comparison of existingsensors. Specifically, this paper examines the characteristics and applications of differentsensors. A better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of oil spill surveillancesensors will improve the operational use of these sensors for oil spill response andcontingency planning. Laser fluorosensors were found to be the best available sensor for oilspill detection since they not only detect and classify oil on all surfaces but also operate ineither the day or night. For example, the Scanning Laser Environmental AirborneFluorosensor (SLEAF) sensor was identified to be a valuable tool for oil spill surveillance.However, no single sensor was able to provide all information required for oil spillcontingency planning. Hence, combinations of sensors are currently used for oil spillsurveillance. Specifically, satellite sensors are used for preliminary oil spill assessmentwhile airborne sensors are used for detailed oil spill analysis. While satellite remote sensingis not suitable for tactical oil spill planning it can provide a synoptic coverage of theaffected area.}

  abstract = "Remote-sensing for oil spills is reviewed. The use of visible techniques is ubiquitous, however it gives only the same results as visual monitoring. Oil has no particular spectral features that would allow for identification among the many possible background interferences. Cameras are only useful to provide documentation. In daytime oil absorbs light and remits this as thermal energy at temperatures 3–8K above ambient, this is detectable by infrared (IR) cameras. Laser fluorosensors are useful instruments because of their unique capability to identify oil on backgrounds that include water, soil, weeds, ice and snow. They are the only sensor that can positively discriminate oil on most backgrounds. Radar detects oil on water by the fact that oil will dampen water-surface capillary waves under low to moderate wave/wind conditions. Radar offers the only potential for large area searches, day/night and foul weather remote sensing."

The aim is to find the location of a region that is the source of a given substance of interest (e.g. a chemical pollutant at sea or a gas leakage in air) using a group of cooperative autonomous vehicles.

The economic criterion is measured by total cost, while the measure of responsiveness is the time span of the entire response operations. A bi-criterion, multiperiod mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is developed that simultaneously predicts the optimal time trajectories of oil volume and slick area, transportation profile, response resource utilization levels, cleanup schedule, and coastal protection plan. The MILP model integrates with the prediction of an oil weathering model that accounts for oil physicochemical properties, spilled amount, hydrodynamics, and weather conditions. The multi-objective optimization model is solved with the epsilon-constraint method and produces a Pareto optimal curve that reveals how the optimal total cost and response operations change under different specifications of responsiveness. We present two illustrative examples for oil spill incidents in the Gulf of Mexico and New England."

To limit the damage by a spill and facilitate cleanup efforts, emergency managers need information on spill location, size and extent, direction and speed of oil movement, and wind, current, and wave information for predicting oil drift and dispersion. The main operational data requirements are fast turn-around time and frequent imaging to monitor the dynamics of the spill. Remote sensors on satellites and aircraft meet most of these requirements by tracking the spilled oil at various resolutions, over wide areas, and at frequent intervals. They also provide key inputs to drift prediction models and facilitate targeting of skimming and booming efforts. Satellite data are frequently supplemented by information provided by aircraft, ships, and remotely-controlled underwater robots. The Sea Princess tanker grounding off the coast of Wales and the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig in the Gulf of Mexico provide good examples for studying the effectiveness of remote sensors during oil-spill emergencies.}

However, the drifting speed of SOTAB-II was lower than a theoretical speed for the oil slick. In order to overcome this problem, SOTAB-II was redesigned. A yacht shape was adopted to reduce the hydrodynamic drag in the water in the advancing direction. Transverse stability, scales of brake board and sail, maneuverability, and performance of tracking spilled oil on the sea surface were considered in the process of the design.",

We have developed a new dispersant that is effective at much lower dosages than currently available products. For ice conditions, we have developed a concept to utilize the propellar wash of response vessels to supply the necessary energy to more effectively disperse dispersant-treated oil. In situ-burning has undergone extensive evaluation as an oil spill response option including a multi-year joint-industry research project evaluating a concept to enhance in situ burning in ice using chemical herders. Recent research indicates that chemical herders can also enhance in situ burning in open water. In addition, we have initiated research on a novel concept to use oleophilic skimmers in conjunction with mini floating incinerators to allow immediate in situ burning. 
We are also studying tools to enhance our ability to remotely detect and track oil slicks on the water surface as well as underneath ice. For oil under ice, we have been studying the use of a helicopter-mounted nuclear magnetic resonance sensor to detect, track, and map oil location and relative density. We are also studying methods to detect and determine the thickness of oil slicks using remotely controlled helicopters.},

This paper focuses on the cooperative control strategy of the two vessels. Each vessel's behavior is governed by a supervisor software module that handles the communication with the other vessel and controls all elementary tasks that compose the overall mission. The elementary tasks, specifically developed for under-actuated vessels, are arranged by priority, and merged using a behavior-based approach, namely the Null-Space based Behavioral control. The proposed technique is validated by field experiments with two autonomous robotic boats on the surface of a lake.}

  abstract={This poster is a review of oil spill tracking devices from 1970 until the present. Since the early 1970's devices for tracking oil spills have been made and tested. Very early in the oil spill technology, cardboard coupons, plywood pieces and similar devices were tried. Later more sophisticated devices were developed and commercialized. Some devices were equipped with radio transmitters and later satellite transmitters. A literature review shows that more than 25 devices were proposed and about 20 tested to some degree. Testing programs on many oil spill tracking devices were carried out. Testing using actual slicks was carried out in the 1970's and 1980's. These tests showed that two of the slick tracking devices followed oil very well. Some buoys tracked the oil slick only with large deviations and most devices were not found to be useful for tracking the oil. Some buoys or devices did not even follow the direction of the test slicks. Later testing showed that some surrogates such as cedar oil in cedar wood chips were useful and thus testing could be carried out without actual oil. The test results are summarized and results given. Devices are listed along with the deviation from the true slicks as found in the various tests.},

Oil slick thickness and oil-to-water emulsion ratios are key spill response parameters for containment/cleanup and were derived quantitatively for thick (>0.1mm) slicks from AVIRIS (Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer) data using a spectral library approach based on the shape and depth of near infrared spectral absorption features. MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite, visible-spectrum broadband data of surface-slick modulation of sunglint reflection allowed extrapolation to the total slick. A multispectral expert system used a neural network approach to provide Rapid Response thickness class maps. Airborne and satellite synthetic aperture radar (SAR) provides synoptic data under all-sky conditions; however, SAR generally cannot discriminate thick (>100μm) oil slicks from thin sheens (to 0.1μm). The UAVSAR's (Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle SAR) significantly greater signal-to-noise ratio and finer spatial resolution allowed successful pattern discrimination related to a combination of oil slick thickness, fractional surface coverage, and emulsification. In situ burning and smoke plumes were studied with AVIRIS and corroborated spaceborne CALIPSO (Cloud Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) observations of combustion aerosols. CALIPSO and bathymetry lidar data documented shallow subsurface oil, although ancillary data were required for confirmation. Airborne hyperspectral, thermal infrared data have nighttime and overcast collection advantages and were collected as well as MODIS thermal data. However, interpretation challenges and a lack of Rapid Response Products prevented significant use. Rapid Response Products were key to response utilization—data needs are time critical; thus, a high technological readiness level is critical to operational use of remote sensing products. DWH's experience demonstrated that development and operationalization of new spill response remote sensing tools must precede the next major oil spill."

  abstract = { Certain marine algae produce potent toxins that impact human health through the consumption of contaminated shellfish and finfish and through water or aerosol exposure. Over the past three decades, the frequency and global distribution of toxic algal incidents appear to have increased, and human intoxications from novel algal sources have occurred. This increase is of particular concern, since it parallels recent evidence of large-scale ecologic disturbances that coincide with trends in global warming. The extent to which human activities have contributed to their increase therefore comes into question. This review summarizes the origins and health effects of marine algal toxins, as well as changes in their current global distribution, and examines possible causes for the recent increase in their occurrence. }

A freely-falling Electro-Magnetic Velocity Profiler, EMVP, senses the currents as a function of depth. Velocity is inferred as the equivalent velocities required to generate the observed electric currents in the local geomagnetic field. The inferred velocity profile is relative to an unknown, but depth-independent, velocity contribution. Hence, the profiles are of the depth-variable velocity components. The device is released from the surface, falls to a preset depth or to the sea floor and returns to the surface. Both descent and ascent take about 90 min in water 6000 m deep. The r.m.s. velocity errors are about 1 to 2 cm s−1 at the vertical resolution of independent methods, 50 m and larger. Simultaneous profiles by two identical EMVPs have r.m.s. velocity differences of less than 0.7 cm s−1 at a vertical resolution of 10 m. A second electric measurement on the instrument yields a velocity profile within 0.3 cm s−1 r.m.s. of the first electric measurement every 10 m. A performance level of ±1 cm s−1 at a vertical resolution of 10 m is indicated. This level is expected in the absence of strong magnetotelluric currents, which can produce errors as large as 10 cm s−1 during infrequent (10 to 20 times per year) periods of strong temporal fluctuations of the geomagnetic field. Temperature, electrical conductivity, pressure, and other variables are recorded twice each second. The digitally recorded data are processed aboard ship to obtain velocity and density profiles."

We used a new platform, a Wave Glider (Liquid Robotics) to observe air-sea processes during a typhoon, equivalent to a category 4-hurricane, at peak strength, near Okinawa, Japan. Surface winds showed strong asymmetry in both speed and direction, faster fore than aft. Rotations of surface winds and currents were not coupled; currents rotated clockwise in the wake of the typhoon eye after passage of rapid wind rotations. Wind work was mostly done ahead of the eye, amplifying prior inertial motions with a phase shift. Wind-induced energy was nearly balanced with an increase in estimated kinetic energy of the upper ocean current, relative to prior inertial oscillations. This study provides a newer, more complete view of actual atmosphere-ocean interactions in a typhoon.},

abstract = {A large-eddy simulation (LES) model, which adopts wave-averaged equations with vortex force, is used to investigate Langmuir turbulence and ocean boundary layer (OBL) dynamics in high-wind hurricane conditions. The temporally evolving spatially asymmetric wind and wave Stokes drift velocity imposed in the LES are generated by a spectral wave prediction model adapted to Hurricane Frances traveling at a speed of 5.5 m s−1. The potency of Langmuir turbulence depends on the turbulent Langmuir number, the wind–Stokes drift alignment, and the depth scale of the Stokes profile Ds relative to the OBL depth h. At the time of maximum winds, large-scale vigorous coherent cells develop on the right-hand side of the storm under the inertially rotating winds; the Stokes drift velocity is well tuned to the surface winds. Much weaker cells develop on the left-hand side of the storm, partly because of reduced Stokes production. With misaligned winds and waves the vertical momentum fluxes can be counter to the gradient of Stokes drift, and the cell orientation tracks the direction of the mean Lagrangian shear. The entrainment flux is increased by 20\% and the sea surface temperature is 0.25 K cooler on the right-hand side of the storm in the presence of Langmuir turbulence. Wave effects impact entrainment when the ratio Ds/|h| > 0.75. Because of wind–wave asymmetry Langmuir cells add quantitatively to the left–right asymmetry already understood for hurricanes due to resonance. And the transient evolution of the OBL cannot be understood simply in terms of equilibrium snapshots.}

Accomplishments include buoy loitering for validation exercises, data gap filling, platform redeployments, and an interception of the fringes of Tropical Storm Hanna. Preliminary buoy loitering assessments using bias and absolute error metrics showed reasonable agreement with buoys for atmospheric pressure, wave, and height-adjusted wind data but that the temperature hardware requires an improved sensor. A full assessment of the potential for the sustained collection and real-time dissemination of environmental data for Wave Glider platforms is presented including lessons learned.",

The OFDA/CRED Database contains data on international disasters and is maintained by the Centre for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters in Brussels (CRED) in cooperation with United States Office for Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA). Information from this source on a large number of flood events, which occurred between January 1975 and June 2002, is evaluated with respect to flood location and flood type. Due to the limited availability of information on coastal flood events, the scope of this study is limited to three types of freshwater flooding: river floods, flash floods and drainage problems. First, the development of loss of life statistics over time is discussed. Second, the dataset is analysed by region, by flood type and by the combination of type and region. The study shows that flash floods result in the highest average mortality per event (the number of fatalities divided by the number of affected persons). A cross analysis by flood type and location shows that average mortality is relatively constant for the different types over various continents, while the magnitude of the impacts (numbers of killed) and affected for a certain type varies between the different continents. On a worldwide scale Asian river floods are most significant in terms of number of persons killed and affected. Finally, a comparison with figures for other types of natural disasters shows that floods are the most significant disaster type in terms of the number of persons affected.",

abstract = "Flood damage modelling has traditionally been limited to the local, regional or national scale. Recent flood events, population growth and climate change concerns have increased the need for global methods with both spatial and temporal dynamics. This paper presents a first estimation of global economic exposure to both river and coastal flooding for the period 1970–2050, using two different methods for damage assessment. One method is based on population and the second is based on land-use within areas subject to 1/100 year flood events. On the basis of population density and GDP per capita, we estimate a total global exposure to river and coastal flooding of 46 trillion USD in 2010. By 2050, these numbers are projected to increase to 158 trillion USD. Using a land-use based assessment, we estimated a total flood exposure of 27 trillion USD in 2010. For 2050 we simulate a total exposure of 80 trillion USD. The largest absolute exposure changes between 1970 and 2050 are simulated in North America and Asia. In relative terms we project the largest increases in North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa. The models also show systematically larger growth in the population living within hazard zones compared to total population growth. While the methods unveil similar overall trends in flood exposure, there are significant differences in the estimates and geographical distribution. These differences result from inherent model characteristics and the varying relationship between population density and the total urban area in the regions of analysis. We propose further research on the modelling of inundation characteristics and flood protection standards, which can complement the methodologies presented in this paper to enable the development of a global flood risk framework."
